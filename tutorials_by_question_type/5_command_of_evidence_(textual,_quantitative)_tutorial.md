# SAT Reading Tutorial: Command of Evidence (Textual, Quantitative)

# Introduction

Here's a draft introduction:

Command of Evidence questions in SAT Reading aren't just another test hurdle—they're your strategic opportunity to demonstrate precise analytical thinking, especially within Natural Sciences passages. These questions challenge you to do more than simply understand text; they require you to pinpoint exactly how and why you've reached a specific interpretation.

Typically, you'll encounter stems like "Which quote most strongly supports the previous answer?" or "Which data point best illustrates the researcher's central claim?" In Natural Sciences—particularly Life Sciences—these questions test your ability to trace scientific reasoning from evidence to conclusion. A biology passage might describe cellular mutation and then ask you to select the precise textual reference that validates a specific claim about genetic processes.

Why are these questions crucial? They're essentially a two-step reasoning challenge that rewards careful, methodical reading. By requiring you to not just comprehend content, but to demonstrate the logical connections between evidence and interpretation, these questions mirror real scientific reasoning.

Imagine you're taking the exam and encounter a passage about evolutionary adaptation. Suddenly, a Command of Evidence question appears. Your heart might race—but here's a quick pro tip: Always return to the specific details in the text, tracing the logical pathway between claim and supporting information.

The key is staying calm, systematic, and confident. These questions aren't designed to trick you, but to assess your ability to think like a careful, precise scientific reader. By understanding their structure and practicing strategic approaches, you'll transform what seems challenging into an opportunity to showcase your analytical skills.

# Practice

## Let's Practice

Here's a typical SAT Reading Natural Sciences passage that tests Command of Evidence (Textual, Quantitative) skills:

The use of five dosages increased the chance of finding one dosage that would result in an adequate mutation frequency. The use of a control treatment made it possible to assess how each of the dosages influenced germination and the frequency of mutation. Before treatment, the seeds were brought to 14% moisture. Adjustment of moisture would be considered a pretreatment. It is assumed that the breeder had some prior knowledge that this step would be useful when using cobalt-60 radiation. The M1 seeds were planted in the field. Although rice is self-pollinated, the M1 plants were isolated by 11 m from untreated rice genotypes to prevent outcrossing. ________

Now, try this question:

Which quotation from the passage best supports the idea that the experiment was designed to compare different treatment effects?

Consider these options:
A) "The use of five dosages increased the chance of finding one dosage that would result in an adequate mutation frequency."
B) "Before treatment, the seeds were brought to 14% moisture."
C) "The M1 seeds were planted in the field."
D) "Although rice is self-pollinated, the M1 plants were isolated by 11 m from untreated rice genotypes"

Take a moment to think about your approach before reading the solution.

# Step-by-Step Solution

Solution Walkthrough:

1. Rephrasing the Question:
Clarify: "Which quote provides the strongest evidence that the experiment was designed to systematically compare different treatment effects?"

2. Evidence Location Strategy:
- Focus on methodological language indicating comparative design
- Look for phrases suggesting intentional variation and controlled comparison

Key Evidence Quote: "The use of five dosages increased the chance of finding one dosage that would result in an adequate mutation frequency. The use of a control treatment made it possible to assess how each of the dosages influenced germination and the frequency of mutation."

3. Elimination Process:
- Choice B (moisture adjustment): Preparatory step, not comparative design
- Choice C (field planting): Describes location, not experimental comparison
- Choice D (isolation): Prevents genetic contamination, not treatment comparison

Critical Practice Recommendation:
Complete 2-3 timed Natural Sciences passages weekly, focusing specifically on evidence selection and verification skills. Analyze mistakes systematically, tracking patterns in your error types.

By implementing these targeted strategies, students can significantly enhance their Command of Evidence performance in SAT Reading's scientific passages.

# Moving Forward

Here's a concise conclusion for Command of Evidence questions in Natural Sciences passages:

Mastering Command of Evidence questions requires a disciplined, evidence-driven approach. The key is always returning to the text, carefully tracing claims to their precise textual or quantitative sources, and resisting the temptation to rely on prior knowledge or intuition. When practicing, focus on developing a systematic method: first, thoroughly understand the passage's core argument, then methodically track how specific evidence supports or challenges that argument.

The most common pitfall is selecting an answer that seems plausible but lacks direct textual support. Always demand clear, explicit connections between the passage and your chosen response. Remember, these questions aren't about what you think might be true, but what the text definitively demonstrates.

By consistently practicing this evidence-centered reading strategy, you'll not only improve your test performance but also develop critical analytical skills that extend far beyond standardized testing. Stay patient, stay precise, and trust the evidence.
