## Passage
The great saphenous vein (GSV) represents a marvel of human vasculature. It originates in the medial aspect of the foot as part of the dorsal arch and continues proximally along the medial aspect of the foot. After passing anterior to the medial malleolus on the tibia_ the vein ascends along the medial aspect of the leg between the superficial and deep fascia. With typically 10â€“20 valves, it terminates at the saphenofemoral junction where blood flow enters the femoral vein. While venous anatomy varies among individuals, the GSV generally features branching superficial veins, including the anterior and posterior accessory saphenous veins in the thigh.
