## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024).

## Passage
The process of DNA amplification in modern laboratories _____ three essential steps that occur within a specialized machine called a thermocycler. First, the DNA strands separate at high temperatures around 95Â°C. Then, specific primers attach to the separated strands in a process known as annealing. Finally, an enzyme called polymerase builds new DNA strands using the available building blocks. These steps repeat multiple times to create millions of DNA copies.
