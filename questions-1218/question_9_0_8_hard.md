## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya et al. (2024), discussing the principles of ultrasound wave attenuation in medical imaging.

## Passage
While researching ultrasound wave behavior in medical imaging, a student has taken the following notes:

1. Ultrasound waves experience significant attenuation when traveling through biological tissues due to absorption and scattering.

2. The presence of air bubbles in tissue creates nearly impenetrable barriers to ultrasound waves, as air has higher resistance to ultrasound propagation than fluids.

3. According to Beer's law, ultrasound intensity decreases exponentially with tissue depth, with absorption accounting for 60-80% of total attenuation.

4. Multiple factors affect attenuation: increasing distance from the transducer, acoustic impedance mismatches between different tissue types, and higher frequency of the ultrasound waves.

## Question
The student wants to explain to medical students why certain anatomical structures are more challenging to image with ultrasound. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?

## Skill
Rhetorical Synthesis

## Choices
- A) The exponential decrease in ultrasound intensity with tissue depth makes imaging deep structures difficult
- B) Air bubbles in tissue create barriers that prevent ultrasound waves from penetrating effectively
- C) The combination of air interfaces, tissue depth, and varying acoustic impedance creates significant challenges for ultrasound imaging
- D) Beer's law explains how absorption accounts for most of the ultrasound wave attenuation in tissue

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: While true, this only addresses one aspect of the imaging challenges
- B) Incorrect: This focuses solely on air interfaces without considering other important factors
- C) Correct: This synthesizes multiple key factors from the notes to provide a comprehensive explanation of imaging challenges
- D) Incorrect: This focuses too narrowly on the mathematical model without explaining practical implications
