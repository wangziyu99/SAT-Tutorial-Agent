## Abstract
The following texts are adapted from "Modern Agricultural Practices" by Dr. Sarah Chen and "Traditional Farming Methods" by Dr. James Wilson (2024).

## Passage
Text 1:
Traditional farming methods relied heavily on natural rainfall patterns and seasonal changes. Farmers would plant crops based on generations of knowledge about weather cycles, often incorporating cultural practices like planting during certain moon phases. This approach, while time-tested, was highly susceptible to weather variations and could result in significant crop losses during unusual weather patterns.

Text 2:
Modern irrigation systems have revolutionized farming practices worldwide. These systems allow farmers to provide consistent water supply to crops regardless of natural rainfall patterns. Computer-controlled drip irrigation can deliver precise amounts of water directly to plant roots, significantly reducing water waste while improving crop yields.

## Question
How would the author of Text 1 most likely view the developments described in Text 2?

## Skill
Cross-Text Connections

## Choices
- A) With relief, as it addresses the main vulnerability of traditional farming methods
- B) With skepticism, as it ignores cultural farming practices
- C) With indifference, as traditional methods are equally effective
- D) With concern, as it requires significant technological knowledge

## Answer
- A) Correct: The author of Text 1 emphasizes the vulnerability of traditional farming to weather variations, so they would likely welcome a solution that addresses this specific challenge
- B) Incorrect: While Text 1 mentions cultural practices, it doesn't suggest they are essential or that they should be preserved over more effective methods
- C) Incorrect: Text 1 clearly acknowledges the limitations of traditional methods, particularly regarding weather dependency
- D) Incorrect: The technological aspect of modern irrigation isn't presented as a barrier in either text
