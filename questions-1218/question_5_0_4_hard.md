## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya, Sithole, Welsh, and Dana (2024).

## Passage
When ultrasound waves encounter tissue boundaries, they undergo several complex interactions that form the foundation of medical imaging. The most crucial of these interactions is reflection, which occurs when waves encounter interfaces between different tissue types. The degree of reflection depends primarily on two factors: the angle at which the waves strike the boundary and the difference in acoustic impedance between adjacent tissues. Acoustic impedance, representing a tissue's resistance to ultrasound passage, _________. This property explains why certain structures appear more prominently in ultrasound images, while others remain less distinct. For instance, the substantial impedance difference between soft tissue and bone results in strong reflections, making bone-tissue interfaces particularly visible in ultrasound imaging.

## Question
Which choice most effectively completes the sentence while maintaining the technical accuracy and analytical tone of the passage?

## Skill
Command of Evidence (Textual, Quantitative)

## Choices
- A) determines how clearly structures appear in the final image
- B) varies directly with the density and elastic properties of the medium
- C) affects the speed at which ultrasound waves travel through tissue
- D) creates interference patterns that must be filtered out

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: Oversimplifies the relationship between acoustic impedance and image formation
- B) Correct: Accurately describes the scientific relationship between acoustic impedance and tissue properties while maintaining the technical tone
- C) Incorrect: Confuses acoustic impedance with propagation velocity
- D) Incorrect: Misrepresents the role of acoustic impedance in ultrasound imaging
