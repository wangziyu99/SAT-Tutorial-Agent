## Abstract
The following passage is adapted from "Modern Agricultural Practices" by Dr. Sarah Chen and Dr. James Wilson (2024).

## Passage
Text 1:
Traditional plant breeding relies on selecting plants with desired traits and crossing them over multiple generations. This process, while effective, can take several years to produce results. Farmers have used these methods for thousands of years to develop crops with better yields, disease resistance, and nutritional value.

Text 2:
Modern genetic engineering allows scientists to directly modify plant DNA, introducing specific traits in a single generation. This technology can create crops with enhanced characteristics much faster than traditional breeding. However, some consumers express concerns about genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in their food supply.

## Question
How would the author of Text 1 most likely respond to the claims made in Text 2?

## Skill
Cross-Text Connections

## Choices
- A) Support, because both methods aim to improve crop characteristics
- B) Opposition, because traditional methods are more natural than genetic engineering
- C) Indifference, because the two methods serve different purposes
- D) Skepticism, because genetic engineering is too new to be reliable

## Answer
- A) Correct: The passage presents traditional breeding as "effective," suggesting the author would support any method that achieves similar goals of crop improvement
- B) Incorrect: Text 1 doesn't express preference for "natural" methods or criticize modern techniques
- C) Incorrect: Both texts discuss methods for the same purpose - improving crop characteristics
- D) Incorrect: Text 1 doesn't suggest any skepticism toward new breeding methods
