## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Arbin Thapaliya, Alec Sithole, Michael Welsh, and Gaston Dana (2024).

## Passage
While researching ultrasound imaging artifacts, a student has taken the following notes:

1. Ultrasound imaging operates on the assumption that sound beams travel in straight lines through tissue.

2. Mirror image artifacts occur when sound waves encounter highly reflective surfaces, creating false duplicate images of structures.

3. Refraction artifacts appear when sound waves change direction due to varying tissue densities, particularly at the edges of circular structures like cysts.

4. These artifacts can significantly impact diagnostic accuracy, especially during procedures like guided needle biopsies where precise anatomical identification is crucial.

5. Modern ultrasound technology employs various correction algorithms to minimize these artifacts, though complete elimination remains challenging.

## Question
The student wants to explain to medical residents why understanding ultrasound artifacts is crucial for clinical practice. Which choice most effectively uses the notes to accomplish this goal?

## Skill
Rhetorical Synthesis

## Choices
- A) Understanding ultrasound artifacts is important because sound waves don't always travel in straight lines through tissue
- B) Mirror image artifacts create duplicate images that can confuse anatomical interpretation during critical procedures like biopsies
- C) The presence of artifacts in ultrasound imaging demonstrates the limitations of current technology
- D) Modern correction algorithms help reduce artifacts in ultrasound imaging

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: Too general and doesn't connect to clinical significance
- B) Correct: Effectively combines technical information with practical clinical implications, specifically highlighting the impact on patient care during procedures
- C) Incorrect: Focuses on limitations without addressing clinical relevance
- D) Incorrect: Emphasizes solutions rather than explaining clinical importance
