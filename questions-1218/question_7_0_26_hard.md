## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Arbin Thapaliya, Alec Sithole, Michael Welsh, and Gaston Dana (2024).

## Passage
When analyzing ultrasound artifacts caused by speed variations in tissue_ researchers must consider multiple factors that affect image accuracy. The standard calibration assumes a uniform speed of 1540 m/s, but biological tissues often deviate from this value. For speeds exceeding 1540 m/s, reflector depths appear underestimated due to shortened transmission-reception times. Conversely, slower speeds result in overestimated distances. While adjusting beam angles may minimize these discrepancies, complete elimination of speed error artifacts remains impossible. Therefore, clinicians must exercise particular caution in interpreting these images, often capturing multiple angles to verify authentic reflector positions.

## Question
Which choice most effectively completes the text while maintaining proper punctuation and sentence structure?

## Skill
Boundaries

## Choices
- A) tissue,
- B) tissue:
- C) tissue;
- D) tissue

## Answer
- A) Correct: The comma correctly separates the introductory dependent clause from the main clause that follows.
- B) Incorrect: A colon is inappropriate here as the following information isn't a list or direct explanation.
- C) Incorrect: A semicolon would incorrectly separate a dependent clause from its main clause.
- D) Incorrect: Using no punctuation would create a run-on sentence by failing to separate the dependent and independent clauses.
