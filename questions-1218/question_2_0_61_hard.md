## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Arbin Thapaliya, Alec Sithole, Michael Welsh, and Gaston Dana (2024).

## Passage
The relationship between gestational accuracy and ultrasound diagnostics presents a fascinating paradox in prenatal medicine. As pregnancy progresses, while imaging technology provides increasingly detailed anatomical information, the margin of error in gestational age estimation actually widens. This phenomenon reflects the complex interplay between technological precision and biological variability. Early-stage measurements might vary by mere days, but later assessments can deviate by weeks, despite enhanced imaging capabilities. This apparent contradiction _____ our understanding of fetal development, suggesting that individual genetic and environmental factors progressively overshadow standardized measurements. The implications extend beyond mere dating accuracy, fundamentally affecting how we approach prenatal diagnostics and therapeutic interventions across different gestational stages.

## Question
Which choice best completes the underlined portion to maintain the analytical tone while emphasizing the passage's central idea about the relationship between technological capability and biological variation?

## Skill
Text Structure and Purpose

## Choices
- A) revolutionizes
- B) complicates
- C) undermines
- D) illuminates

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: Too strong and absolute for the nuanced discussion
- B) Incorrect: Suggests a negative impact that isn't supported by the passage
- C) Incorrect: Implies the relationship invalidates previous knowledge, which isn't the passage's point
- D) Correct: Best captures the passage's analytical tone while suggesting that this paradox provides deeper insight into our understanding of fetal development, aligning with the passage's purpose of exploring the complex relationship between technology and biological variation
