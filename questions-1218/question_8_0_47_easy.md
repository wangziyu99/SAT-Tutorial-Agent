## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024).

## Passage
The success of modern wheat breeding _____ largely on the careful selection of parent plants with desirable traits. At North Dakota State University, researchers developed a systematic approach to wheat breeding that combines traditional methods with innovative techniques. Their process begins with selecting parent plants that show resistance to common diseases and favorable growth characteristics. After the initial cross between selected parents, scientists carefully monitor the resulting plants through multiple generations, evaluating traits such as disease resistance, plant height, and maturity timing.
