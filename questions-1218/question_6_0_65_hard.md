## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" (2024) by Thapaliya, Sithole, Welsh, and Dana.

## Passage
In musculoskeletal sonography, the visualization of anatomical structures requires precise technique and understanding of acoustic principles. When examining bone structures, the normal cortex appears as a smooth, uniform, and hyperechoic surface. However, the accuracy of these images critically depends on _________. While experienced technicians can readily identify pathological changes such as fractures or arthritic deposits, the interpretation of these images requires careful consideration of potential artifacts and technical limitations. The relationship between the transducer angle and the anatomical structure being examined becomes particularly crucial in distinguishing between actual pathology and artificial distortions.

## Question
Which choice most logically completes the text?

## Skill
Inferences

## Choices
- A) the proper alignment of sound waves relative to the target tissue
- B) the frequency settings of the ultrasound equipment
- C) the patient's position during the examination
- D) the resolution capabilities of the imaging system

## Answer
- A) Correct: This answer logically completes the passage as it directly relates to the later discussion of transducer angle and artifacts, while also explaining why precise technique is necessary.
- B) Incorrect: While frequency settings are important in ultrasound, the passage specifically emphasizes alignment and positioning rather than equipment settings.
- C) Incorrect: Although patient positioning matters, the passage focuses more on technical aspects of wave transmission and image formation.
- D) Incorrect: While resolution is important for image quality, the passage emphasizes the relationship between sound waves and tissue rather than equipment capabilities.
