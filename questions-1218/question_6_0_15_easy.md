## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Understanding Marine Biology" by Dr. Sarah Chen (2024).

## Passage
Marine biologists have long been fascinated by the feeding patterns of whales. Blue whales, despite being the largest animals on Earth, survive primarily on tiny crustaceans called krill. During feeding season, these massive creatures can consume up to 6 tons of krill each day. The whales use a unique feeding method called filter feeding, where they take in enormous amounts of water and filter out their prey using specialized structures called baleen plates. This process is ___________, allowing the whales to efficiently capture large quantities of their small prey while expelling excess water.

## Question

## Skill
Inferences

## Choices
- A) remarkably streamlined
- B) somewhat dangerous
- C) occasionally successful
- D) randomly executed

## Answer
- A) Correct: This answer logically fits the context as the passage describes an efficient feeding process that enables whales to capture large amounts of prey.
- B) Incorrect: Nothing in the passage suggests the feeding process is dangerous.
- C) Incorrect: The passage indicates this is a reliable feeding method, not just occasionally successful.
- D) Incorrect: The passage describes a systematic process, not a random one.
