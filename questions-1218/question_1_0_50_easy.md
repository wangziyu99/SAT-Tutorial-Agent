## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024).

## Passage
In modern plant breeding, scientists must carefully _____ their selection methods to ensure the best possible outcomes. When working with resistant plant varieties, breeders typically start by identifying parent plants with desirable traits. These plants are then grown in controlled environments where their characteristics can be closely monitored. The most promising specimens are selected and allowed to cross-pollinate naturally, producing seeds that carry the desired genetic traits. This process requires patience and precise documentation, as even small variations in growing conditions can affect the results.

## Question
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

## Skill
Words in Context

## Choices
- A) adjust
- B) maintain
- C) regulate
- D) control

## Answer
- A) Correct: "Adjust" is the most logical choice as it suggests the flexible, responsive nature of selection methods that breeders must employ based on different situations and goals.
- B) Incorrect: While "maintain" implies consistency, it doesn't capture the need for adaptation in breeding methods.
- C) Incorrect: "Regulate" suggests strict control but misses the aspect of adaptation needed in the context.
- D) Incorrect: "Control" is too forceful and doesn't convey the careful fine-tuning implied in the passage.
