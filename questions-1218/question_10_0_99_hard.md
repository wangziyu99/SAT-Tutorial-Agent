## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Arbin Thapaliya, Alec Sithole, Michael Welsh, and Gaston Dana (2024).

## Passage
Modern ultrasound imaging has revolutionized vascular diagnostics through its non-invasive approach to vessel visualization. The great saphenous vein (GSV) requires meticulous examination in both transverse and sagittal planes for accurate assessment. _____ traditional imaging focused primarily on transverse views, contemporary protocols mandate comprehensive dual-plane imaging with color Doppler augmentation. This evolution in technique has significantly enhanced the detection of venous abnormalities and improved diagnostic accuracy. The combination of above-knee and below-knee imaging, particularly when enhanced with color Doppler, provides clinicians with crucial hemodynamic information that was previously difficult to obtain through conventional methods.

## Question
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

## Skill
Transitions

## Choices
- A) Although
- B) Similarly,
- C) Moreover,
- D) Otherwise,

## Answer
- A) Correct: This transition word effectively sets up the contrast between past and present imaging approaches, establishing a clear shift in medical practices.
- B) Incorrect: "Similarly" suggests a continuation of the same idea rather than the intended contrast between traditional and contemporary methods.
- C) Incorrect: "Moreover" suggests additional information rather than the contrast needed between old and new techniques.
- D) Incorrect: "Otherwise" implies a consequence or alternative scenario, which doesn't fit the logical relationship between the two imaging approaches being discussed.
