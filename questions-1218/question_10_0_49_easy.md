## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024).

## Passage
Plant breeders must carefully select specimens for disease resistance in their breeding programs. During initial screenings, approximately 40% of plants showing disease susceptibility were removed from consideration. _____ the remaining plants were transferred to field conditions for further evaluation. This second phase of testing revealed that an additional 8.7% of plants displayed disease susceptibility, requiring their removal. The surviving plants, all demonstrating strong disease resistance, were then allowed to cross-pollinate naturally through insect activity. This selective breeding approach helps ensure that beneficial traits are passed on to future generations.

## Question
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

## Skill
Transitions

## Choices
- A) Subsequently,
- B) However,
- C) Instead,
- D) Similarly,

## Answer
- A) Correct: "Subsequently" correctly indicates the chronological sequence of events, showing that the field transfer happened after the initial screening.
- B) Incorrect: "However" implies a contrast that doesn't exist between the two statements.
- C) Incorrect: "Instead" suggests an alternative action, but the field transfer was a planned next step, not a replacement action.
- D) Incorrect: "Similarly" implies that the field transfer was comparable to the previous action, but it was actually a different phase of the process.
