## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Arbin Thapaliya, Alec Sithole, Michael Welsh, and Gaston Dana (2024).

## Passage
When an ultrasound beam encounters tissue boundaries at an oblique angle_ the transmitted portion undergoes a significant directional change. This phenomenon, known as refraction, occurs due to variations in wave velocities between different tissue types and can lead to imaging artifacts. The degree of refraction depends primarily on the angle of incidence and the acoustic impedance differential between adjacent tissues. Medical professionals must account for these refractive effects when interpreting ultrasound images, as they can produce misleading double images or positional inaccuracies in the final visualization.

## Question
Which choice most effectively completes the sentence while maintaining the formal, academic tone of the passage?

## Skill
Boundaries

## Choices
- A) When an ultrasound beam encounters tissue boundaries at an oblique angle,
- B) When an ultrasound beam encounters tissue boundaries at an oblique angle:
- C) When an ultrasound beam encounters tissue boundaries at an oblique angle;
- D) When an ultrasound beam encounters tissue boundaries at an oblique angleâ€”

## Answer
- A) Correct: A comma is appropriate here as it properly separates the dependent clause from the independent clause that follows.
- B) Incorrect: A colon is inappropriate as the first clause doesn't clearly introduce a list or explanation.
- C) Incorrect: A semicolon is incorrect as it should connect two independent clauses, but the first clause is dependent.
- D) Incorrect: A dash is too informal for this academic context and is typically used for emphasis or interruption, neither of which is appropriate here.
