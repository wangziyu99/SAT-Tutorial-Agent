## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Arbin Thapaliya, Alec Sithole, Michael Welsh, and Gaston Dana (2024).

## Passage
The advancement of musculoskeletal sonography has revolutionized our understanding of anatomical structures, particularly in wrist examination. The intricate arrangement of compartments along the dorsal aspect of the wrist reveals a complex interplay of tendons and ligaments. While traditional imaging methods provided limited insight, ultrasound technology has _________. This technological progression has enabled practitioners to detect subtle pathological changes in real-time, transforming both diagnostic approaches and treatment protocols. The visualization of the scapholunate ligament, with its distinctive hyperechoic fibrillar pattern, exemplifies how modern sonography has enhanced our capacity to identify and assess potential injury sites, particularly in cases involving traumatic wrist extension.
