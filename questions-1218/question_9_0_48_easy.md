## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Modern Plant Breeding Methods: A Practical Guide" by Dr. Sarah Chen (2024).

## Passage
While documenting plant breeding procedures, a student has taken the following notes:
1. Plant breeding involves selecting plants with desired traits and crossing them to create improved varieties.
2. Traditional breeding methods rely on careful observation and record-keeping of plant characteristics across generations.
3. Modern plant breeders use scientific tools like genetic markers to speed up the selection process.
4. Both traditional and modern methods have successfully created crops with higher yields, better disease resistance, and improved nutritional content.
5. Documentation of breeding history helps other scientists replicate and verify results.

## Question
The student wants to explain to novice gardeners how plant breeding has evolved. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?

## Skill
Rhetorical Synthesis

## Choices
- A) Plant breeding requires extensive documentation and record-keeping to track plant characteristics
- B) While traditional breeders relied on careful observation, modern breeding has added scientific tools like genetic markers to improve the process
- C) Plant breeding has successfully created crops with better yields and disease resistance
- D) Both traditional and modern breeding methods require tracking multiple generations of plants

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: Focuses too narrowly on documentation without addressing the evolution of methods
- B) Correct: Effectively contrasts traditional and modern methods while showing progression, making it accessible to novice gardeners
- C) Incorrect: States outcomes but doesn't explain how breeding methods have evolved
- D) Incorrect: Mentions both methods but doesn't clearly explain their differences or evolution
