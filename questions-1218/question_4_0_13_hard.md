## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya, Sithole, Welsh, and Dana (2024).

## Passage
The sophistication of modern ultrasound imaging lies in its dual-mode operational framework. During transmission, the system converts alternating current into mechanical pressure waves, which propagate through biological tissues. These waves interact differently with various tissue interfaces, creating a complex pattern of acoustic reflections. In the receiving mode, backscattered pressure waves are detected and transformed into electrical signals, which ultimately generate the grayscale image. Notably, structures that completely transmit ultrasound waves without reflection appear as dark regions in the final image - a phenomenon particularly evident in fluid-filled spaces. This _______________ principle enables clinicians to distinguish between solid tissues and fluid-filled cavities, making ultrasound an invaluable diagnostic tool in modern medicine.

## Question
Which choice best completes the passage while maintaining its analytical tone and supporting its central focus on the technical aspects of ultrasound imaging?

## Skill
Central Ideas and Details

## Choices
- A) fundamental physical
- B) revolutionary medical
- C) differential acoustic
- D) binary imaging

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: While "physical" is relevant, this choice is too broad and doesn't specifically address the acoustic properties discussed.
- B) Incorrect: "Revolutionary medical" is too general and focuses on the historical impact rather than the technical principle being described.
- C) Correct: "Differential acoustic" precisely captures the technical nature of how different tissues interact with ultrasound waves differently, creating distinct patterns in the final image.
- D) Incorrect: "Binary imaging" oversimplifies the complex grayscale nature of ultrasound imaging described in the passage.
