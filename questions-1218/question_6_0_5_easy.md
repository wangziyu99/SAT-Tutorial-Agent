## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024).

## Passage
Plants are remarkable in their ability to adapt to different environments. When gardeners select plants for their gardens, they often look for specific traits like ________. Some plants thrive in full sunlight, producing vibrant flowers and sturdy stems, while others prefer shaded areas where they develop broader leaves to capture limited light. Understanding these natural tendencies helps gardeners create successful growing environments. Additionally, plants can adjust their growth patterns based on available resources, developing deeper roots in dry conditions or spreading roots near the surface when water is plentiful.

## Question
Which choice most logically completes the text?

## Skill
Inferences

## Choices
- A) height and sun tolerance
- B) root depth and soil type
- C) flower color and leaf shape
- D) growth rate and water needs

## Answer
- A) Correct: This choice logically fits because height and sun tolerance are fundamental characteristics gardeners consider when selecting plants, and these traits directly relate to the passage's subsequent discussion of how plants grow in different light conditions.
- B) Incorrect: While root depth and soil type are important gardening considerations, they don't directly connect to the passage's immediate focus on above-ground plant characteristics and light adaptation.
- C) Incorrect: Though these are visible plant characteristics, they don't specifically relate to the passage's subsequent discussion of environmental adaptation.
- D) Incorrect: While these are relevant plant characteristics, they don't directly connect to the passage's immediate focus on light adaptation and physical characteristics.
