## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024).

## Passage
Modern plant breeding relies heavily on genetic markers to identify desired traits in crops. One of the most valuable traits in soybean breeding is the oil quality. Scientists have discovered that certain genetic variations can _____ the amount of linolenic acid in soybean oil, which is crucial for extending the oil's shelf life. This discovery has led to the development of improved soybean varieties that produce oil with enhanced storage properties, making them more valuable for commercial food production.

## Question
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

## Skill
Words in Context

## Choices
- A) reduce
- B) alter
- C) eliminate
- D) change

## Answer
- A) Correct: "Reduce" is the most precise choice as the passage specifically discusses lowering the linolenic acid content to improve shelf life
- B) Incorrect: While "alter" is related to change, it's too vague and doesn't specify the direction of change needed
- C) Incorrect: "Eliminate" is too extreme; the goal is to lower, not completely remove, the linolenic acid
- D) Incorrect: "Change" is too general and doesn't indicate the specific type of modification needed
