## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Arbin Thapaliya, Alec Sithole, Michael Welsh, and Gaston Dana (2024).

## Passage
The accuracy of diagnostic ultrasound imaging _____ on multiple factors, including the expertise of the sonographer and the quality of the equipment. While technological advancements have improved image resolution significantly, the interpretation of results remains a complex process that requires both technical knowledge and clinical experience. Recent studies indicate that the reliability of ultrasound diagnostics increases substantially when performed by practitioners with specialized training in both equipment operation and anatomical analysis. This dual expertise ensures that the subtle variations in tissue density and echo patterns are correctly interpreted, leading to more accurate diagnoses.
