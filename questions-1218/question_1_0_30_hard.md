## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Arbin Thapaliya, Alec Sithole, Michael Welsh, and Gaston Dana (2024).

## Passage
In medical imaging, the precision of ultrasound technology largely depends on the transducer's ability to _____ acoustic signals through biological tissue. Unlike conventional imaging methods, ultrasound waves must navigate complex cellular structures while maintaining sufficient resolution for diagnostic purposes. The process requires careful calibration of wave frequencies and amplitudes to achieve optimal tissue penetration without compromising image clarity. Modern transducers employ sophisticated algorithms to compensate for signal attenuation and scatter, ensuring that the resulting images provide clinicians with accurate anatomical representations.

## Question
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

## Skill
Words in Context

## Choices
- A) propagate
- B) transmit
- C) conduct
- D) channel

## Answer
- A) Correct: "Propagate" is the most precise term in this context, as it specifically refers to the way waves travel through a medium while maintaining their essential characteristics, which is crucial for ultrasound imaging.
- B) Incorrect: While "transmit" is related to signal movement, it lacks the specific connotation of wave physics that "propagate" carries.
- C) Incorrect: "Conduct" typically refers to the movement of heat or electricity rather than acoustic waves.
- D) Incorrect: "Channel" suggests directing something through a specific path, which doesn't accurately describe how ultrasound waves move through tissue.
