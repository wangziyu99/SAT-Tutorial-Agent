## Abstract
The following passages are adapted from "Medical Imaging Technology" by Dr. Sarah Chen (2024) and "Clinical Applications of Ultrasound" from the Journal of Medical Physics (2024).

## Passage
Text 1:
Recent advances in ultrasound technology have revolutionized medical imaging, particularly in emergency medicine. While traditional diagnostic methods rely heavily on radiation-based imaging, ultrasound offers real-time visualization without ionizing radiation exposure. However, the effectiveness of ultrasound imaging is highly operator-dependent, requiring extensive training and experience to interpret results accurately.

Text 2:
The implementation of standardized ultrasound protocols in emergency departments has led to improved patient outcomes and reduced diagnostic times. These protocols emphasize proper technique and interpretation guidelines, ensuring consistent results across different operators. Critics argue that such standardization may limit the flexibility needed in complex cases where unconventional approaches might be necessary.

## Question
How would the author of Text 1 most likely respond to the standardization approach described in Text 2?

## Skill
Cross-Text Connections

## Choices
- A) Support, because standardization could help address the operator-dependent nature of ultrasound
- B) Opposition, because standardization might restrict the development of advanced imaging techniques
- C) Indifference, because standardization doesn't affect the fundamental physics of ultrasound imaging
- D) Skepticism, because the effectiveness of ultrasound depends more on individual skill than protocols

## Answer
- A) Correct: The author of Text 1 emphasizes the operator-dependent nature of ultrasound as a limitation, so they would likely support standardization efforts that address this challenge
- B) Incorrect: Nothing in Text 1 suggests concern about restricting technical advancement
- C) Incorrect: The author's focus on operator dependency suggests they would not be indifferent to standardization
- D) Incorrect: While Text 1 mentions operator dependency, it presents this as a problem to be solved rather than an unchangeable feature
