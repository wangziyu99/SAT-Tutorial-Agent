## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Arbin Thapaliya, Alec Sithole, Michael Welsh, and Gaston Dana (2024).

## Passage
Portable ultrasound devices have revolutionized medical diagnostics in recent years. The technological advancement in miniaturization, coupled with improvements in image processing capabilities, _____ transformed these devices from bulky, stationary units into compact, versatile tools. Each component of these modern devices, from the transducer array to the digital signal processor, must function in perfect synchronization to produce accurate diagnostic images. The integration of artificial intelligence algorithms with these portable systems has further enhanced their diagnostic capabilities, enabling real-time image analysis and pattern recognition that previously required extensive specialist interpretation.

## Question
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English while maintaining the scientific tone and temporal consistency of the passage?

## Skill
Form, Structure, and Sense

## Choices
- A) has
- B) have
- C) having
- D) had

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: Using "has" would be incorrect as the subject is plural ("advancement" and "improvements")
- B) Correct: "Have" agrees with the compound subject "advancement and improvements" and maintains the present perfect tense consistent with the passage's discussion of recent developments
- C) Incorrect: "Having" would create a participial phrase without a main verb, making the sentence incomplete
- D) Incorrect: "Had" would shift the temporal focus to the past, inconsistent with the passage's discussion of recent and ongoing developments.
