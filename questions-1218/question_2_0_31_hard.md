## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya, Sithole, Welsh, and Dana (2024).

## Passage
The evolution of ultrasound imaging technology represents a significant advancement in medical diagnostics, particularly in its ability to visualize internal structures non-invasively. Contemporary ultrasound systems employ three distinct modes of operation, each serving specialized diagnostic purposes. The amplitude mode, pioneered in early medical imaging, generates linear representations of tissue density, while brightness mode creates detailed grayscale images through sophisticated echo mapping. The motion mode, building upon these foundations, introduces temporal analysis for dynamic tissue observation. The selection of these modes, coupled with appropriate frequency ranges—from 2-5 MHz for deep tissue imaging to 15 MHz for superficial structures—determines the resolution and depth of penetration, thereby influencing diagnostic accuracy.
