## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024).

## Passage
DNA amplification requires several key components for success. _ the researcher must ensure proper preparation of the reaction mixture. This includes adding specific primers that match the target DNA sequence, along with Taq polymerase, an enzyme derived from bacteria. The mixture also requires deoxynucleoside triphosphates, which provide the building blocks for new DNA strands. Finally, the reaction takes place in a thermocycler that precisely controls temperature throughout the process.
