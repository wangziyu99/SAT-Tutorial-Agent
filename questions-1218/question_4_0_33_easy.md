## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024).

## Passage
Modern plant breeding has evolved to include genetic transformation, a powerful tool for crop improvement. In this process, scientists can take genes from one organism and transfer them to another, or modify existing genes within the same species. These introduced genes, called transgenes, become part of the plant through a process called transformation. The success of transformation depends on a special DNA package called a construct. This construct is like a genetic toolkit with four main parts working together. The most important part is the gene that scientists want to add to the plant. Another essential component is a "switch" called a promoter that controls when the gene turns on and off. The construct also includes special markers that help scientists identify which plants successfully received the new genes.

## Question
Which choice best states the main idea of the text?

## Skill
Central Ideas and Details

## Choices
- A) Genetic transformation in plants requires a carefully designed DNA construct with specific components
- B) Modern plant breeding is more advanced than traditional breeding methods
- C) Scientists can transfer genes between different species of plants
- D) Promoters are essential for controlling gene expression in plants

## Answer
- A) Correct: This choice accurately captures the passage's focus on genetic transformation and its key components
- B) Incorrect: While mentioned briefly at the start, this is not the main focus of the passage
- C) Incorrect: This is just one detail mentioned in the passage, not the main idea
- D) Incorrect: While promoters are discussed, they are just one component of the larger topic
