## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024).

## Passage
In the greenhouse, plants are carefully monitored for seed production. _ the botanist must examine each specimen to ensure proper development. The small size of these plants makes individual identification straightforward, as tillering rarely occurs under these conditions. From each plant, researchers extract a single head containing between four and eight seeds. This careful selection process ensures genetic consistency across generations. One healthy seed is then collected from each head and combined with others for the next planting cycle, while the remaining heads are stored as backup in case of crop failure.
