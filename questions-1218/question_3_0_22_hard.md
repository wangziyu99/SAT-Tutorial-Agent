## Abstract
The following excerpts are adapted from two scientific papers: "Quantum Computing in Healthcare" by Dr. Sarah Chen (2023) and "Classical Computing Limitations in Medical Diagnostics" by Dr. James Rodriguez (2024).

## Passage
Text 1:
Quantum computing's potential in healthcare lies in its ability to simulate complex molecular interactions at an unprecedented scale. The quantum approach leverages superposition and entanglement to process multiple molecular configurations simultaneously, potentially revolutionizing drug discovery and personalized medicine. However, current quantum systems face significant challenges in maintaining coherence long enough to perform meaningful calculations.

Text 2:
Traditional computing methods in healthcare have reached their practical limits in processing complex molecular simulations. While classical computers can effectively handle basic molecular modeling, they require exponentially more time and resources as the complexity increases. This computational ceiling has become a critical bottleneck in advancing personalized medicine and drug development.

## Question
How would the author of Text 1 most likely respond to the conclusion presented in Text 2?

## Skill
Cross-Text Connections

## Choices
- A) With qualified agreement, acknowledging the limitations while suggesting quantum computing as a potential solution
- B) With skepticism, since quantum computing already solves the problems mentioned in Text 2
- C) With indifference, as the topics discussed are unrelated to quantum computing's capabilities
- D) With strong disagreement, arguing that classical computing has not reached its limits

## Answer
- A) Correct: The author of Text 1 would likely agree with Text 2's assessment of classical computing limitations while viewing quantum computing as a promising but still-developing solution, given the acknowledgment of current challenges in quantum systems.
- B) Incorrect: Text 1 acknowledges that quantum computing still faces significant challenges, so the author wouldn't claim it already solves these problems.
- C) Incorrect: The topics are directly related, and Text 1 specifically addresses computational approaches to molecular modeling.
- D) Incorrect: Text 1's focus on quantum computing's potential implies agreement with classical computing's limitations.
