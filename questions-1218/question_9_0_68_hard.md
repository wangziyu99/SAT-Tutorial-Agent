## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya, Sithole, Welsh, and Dana (2024).

## Passage
While researching musculoskeletal sonography techniques, a student has taken the following notes:

1. The supraspinatus muscle, a critical component of the rotator cuff, originates in the supraspinatus fossa and attaches to the greater tubercle of the humerus.

2. For optimal ultrasound imaging, patients must assume the modified crass position: sitting upright with the palm on the ipsilateral hip, elbow flexed and pointed posteriorly.

3. This specific positioning technique removes the supraspinatus from beneath the acromion, making it visible for examination.

4. Clinical studies indicate that over 90% of rotator cuff injuries involve the supraspinatus, making its visualization particularly important for diagnostic purposes.

## Question
The student wants to explain to medical residents why proper patient positioning is crucial for shoulder ultrasound imaging. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?

## Skill
Rhetorical Synthesis

## Choices
- A) The modified crass position is the standard technique for examining the supraspinatus muscle during ultrasound imaging
- B) The supraspinatus muscle's attachment points make it difficult to visualize without specific patient positioning
- C) The modified crass position, by moving the supraspinatus from under the acromion, enables clear visualization of this frequently injured rotator cuff component
- D) Since 90% of rotator cuff injuries involve the supraspinatus, proper positioning techniques are essential for diagnosis

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: States the technique without explaining its importance
- B) Incorrect: Focuses on anatomy without connecting it to the imaging benefits
- C) Correct: Effectively synthesizes the positioning technique, its anatomical purpose, and clinical significance
- D) Incorrect: Emphasizes injury statistics without explaining the connection to positioning
