## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Arbin Thapaliya, Alec Sithole, Michael Welsh, and Gaston Dana (2024).

## Passage
Modern echocardiography equipment, which _____ among the most sophisticated diagnostic tools in cardiology, enables physicians to conduct detailed examinations of cardiac function. The technology's ability to generate real-time images of heart structures and blood flow patterns through various chambers has revolutionized non-invasive cardiac assessment. These machines can simultaneously track multiple parameters, including valve dynamics and wall motion, while maintaining exceptional image clarity. The integration of color flow Doppler technology further enhances diagnostic capabilities by providing detailed visualization of blood flow patterns and identifying valve insufficiencies.
