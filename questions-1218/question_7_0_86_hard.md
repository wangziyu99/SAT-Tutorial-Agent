## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Arbin Thapaliya, Alec Sithole, Michael Welsh, and Gaston Dana (2024).

## Passage
Several diagnostic tests provide essential information about renal function_ traditional methods such as urinalysis, serum creatinine measurements, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) assessments offer valuable insights into both normal kidney operation and potential pathologies. For instance, the presence of protein-based glomerular casts in urine samples may suggest immune-mediated glomerulonephritis, while elevated creatinine levels in isolation could indicate diffuse renal failure. Through ultrasound imaging, clinicians can correlate these biochemical markers with anatomical findings, enabling a more comprehensive evaluation of renal conditions.

## Question
Which choice most effectively connects the two independent clauses while maintaining the formal, academic tone of the passage?

## Skill
Boundaries

## Choices
- A) function, as
- B) function; whereas
- C) function, but
- D) function: notably,

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: The comma creates a comma splice between independent clauses
- B) Correct: The semicolon appropriately joins two related independent clauses, and "whereas" maintains the academic tone while establishing a logical relationship
- C) Incorrect: The coordinating conjunction "but" suggests contrast, which doesn't match the passage's logical flow
- D) Incorrect: While a colon can join independent clauses, "notably" creates an awkward transition that disrupts the academic tone
