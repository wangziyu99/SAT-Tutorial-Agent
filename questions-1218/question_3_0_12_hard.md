## Abstract
The following texts are excerpted from scientific journals. Text 1 is from "Immunological Responses in Systemic Infections" (2023) by Dr. Sarah Chen. Text 2 is from "Healthcare Policy Implementation in Modern Medicine" (2023) by Dr. James Robertson.

## Passage
Text 1:
Recent studies reveal that neural plasticity exhibits ___________ characteristics during early development. While traditional models emphasized static pathways, current research indicates that neuronal connections demonstrate remarkable adaptability, particularly in response to environmental stimuli. This adaptive capacity, however, appears to diminish significantly with age, suggesting a critical window for optimal neural development.

Text 2:
The implementation of early intervention programs in pediatric neurology has shown mixed results. While some studies report significant improvements in cognitive outcomes when therapeutic interventions are initiated during periods of heightened neural plasticity, others question the cost-effectiveness of such programs, citing limited long-term benefits beyond conventional developmental support.

## Question
How would the author of Text 1 most likely respond to the skepticism about early intervention programs expressed in Text 2?

## Skill
Cross-Text Connections

## Choices
- A) With indifference, as Text 1 focuses solely on biological mechanisms rather than therapeutic applications
- B) With strong disagreement, as Text 1's emphasis on the critical window for neural plasticity supports early intervention
- C) With agreement, as Text 1 acknowledges the limitations of neural adaptability
- D) With partial support, as Text 1 suggests variable outcomes depending on individual circumstances

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: The author clearly emphasizes the importance of early development
- B) Correct: The author's emphasis on the critical window and diminishing plasticity strongly suggests support for early intervention
- C) Incorrect: While limitations are mentioned, they support rather than contradict early intervention
- D) Incorrect: Text 1 presents a clear position about early developmental importance, not variable outcomes
