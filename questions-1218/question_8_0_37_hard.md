## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Cardiovascular System: Function and Regulation" by Dr. Maria Chen, published in the Journal of Medical Sciences (2024).

## Passage
The human cardiovascular system's efficiency _____ on multiple factors, including blood volume distribution and cardiac output. Under normal conditions, approximately 84% of blood volume circulates through systemic vessels, while the remaining percentage distributes between pulmonary circulation and cardiac chambers. This precise distribution, which has evolved over millions of years, ensures optimal oxygen delivery to tissues and maintains homeostatic balance. The system's adaptability becomes particularly evident during physical exertion, when cardiac output can increase dramatically to meet heightened metabolic demands.
