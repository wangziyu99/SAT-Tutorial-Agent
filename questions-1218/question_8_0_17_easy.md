## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024).

## Passage
Research on mutation breeding has shown promising results in various plant species. A team of scientists _____ currently studying the effects of gamma radiation on different varieties of grass species. Their preliminary findings suggest that controlled exposure to radiation can produce beneficial mutations in plant DNA. These mutations sometimes lead to desirable traits such as shorter plant height or increased resistance to environmental stress. The research team plans to continue their experiments throughout the next growing season.

## Question
Which choice best completes the sentence while maintaining standard English grammar?

## Skill
Form, Structure, and Sense

## Choices
- A) are
- B) is
- C) were

## Answer
- A) Correct: "A team of scientists are" is correct because while "team" is technically singular, it's being used as a collective noun referring to multiple people, and in this context, emphasizing the individual members makes "are" appropriate.
- B) Incorrect: While "is" could be technically correct with "team" as a singular noun, the context emphasizes the multiple scientists working together.
