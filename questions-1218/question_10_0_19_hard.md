## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya, Sithole, Welsh, and Dana (2024).

## Passage
Modern ultrasound imaging technology relies heavily on precise beam focusing and accurate signal interpretation. When ultrasound waves propagate through tissue, they typically follow a primary beam path. ___ this ideal scenario rarely occurs in clinical settings. Side lobes, which are secondary beam formations, often emerge parallel to the main beam axis. These auxiliary beams can create misleading reflections that the ultrasound machine interprets as legitimate anatomical structures. The resulting artifacts pose a significant challenge for medical professionals, as they must distinguish between actual tissue structures and these false echoes. What makes this particularly problematic is that these side lobe artifacts often appear with remarkable consistency, displaying as curved lines equidistant from the transducer surface.

## Question
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

## Skill
Transitions

## Choices
- A) Nevertheless,
- B) Similarly,
- C) Furthermore,
- D) For instance,

## Answer
- A) Correct: This transition word effectively contrasts the ideal scenario with the practical reality, emphasizing the unexpected complications in ultrasound imaging.
- B) Incorrect: "Similarly" suggests a parallel idea, but the passage presents a contrast between ideal and actual conditions.
- C) Incorrect: "Furthermore" suggests additional supporting information, but the passage needs a contrasting transition.
- D) Incorrect: "For instance" suggests an example, but the following sentence presents a contrasting situation rather than an example.
