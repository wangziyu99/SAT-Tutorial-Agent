## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya et al. (2024), discussing the challenges of ultrasound imaging artifacts.

## Passage
Multiple reflections in ultrasound imaging can create significant diagnostic challenges_ particularly when examining interfaces between tissues with different acoustic properties. When ultrasound waves encounter highly reflective surfaces, such as bone-soft tissue boundaries or air-fluid interfaces, the resulting artifacts can complicate image interpretation. These reflections often produce ghost images that mirror the original structure, appearing at twice the distance from the transducer. Medical professionals must carefully distinguish between actual anatomical structures and these artificial duplicates to avoid misdiagnosis.

## Question
Which choice most effectively completes the text while maintaining proper punctuation and clarity?

## Skill
Boundaries

## Choices
- A) particularly,
- B) particularly;
- C) particularly:
- D) particularly

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: Adding a comma creates an unnecessary break in the sentence flow and incorrectly separates the adverb from the clause it modifies.
- B) Incorrect: A semicolon would inappropriately separate what should be a continuous thought.
- C) Incorrect: A colon here would incorrectly suggest that what follows is a list or explanation.
- D) Correct: The adverb "particularly" should flow directly into the when-clause that follows, requiring no punctuation. This maintains the logical connection between the main idea and its qualification.
