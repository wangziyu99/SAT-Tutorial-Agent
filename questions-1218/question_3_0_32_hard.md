## Abstract
The following texts are adapted from "Advances in Medical Imaging Technology" by Dr. Sarah Chen (2023) and "Clinical Applications of Modern Imaging" by Dr. James Martinez (2024).

## Passage
Text 1:
Recent advances in medical imaging have revolutionized diagnostic capabilities through quantum computing integration. The ___________ of traditional imaging methods often fails to detect subtle anatomical variations that could indicate early-stage pathologies. Modern quantum-enhanced imaging systems can process multiple dimensional data simultaneously, offering unprecedented resolution at the cellular level.

Text 2:
While quantum computing shows promise in medical imaging, its clinical implementation faces significant challenges. The cost-benefit analysis of quantum-enhanced imaging systems versus conventional methods remains controversial. Some clinicians argue that the marginal improvements in diagnostic accuracy don't justify the substantial financial investment required for widespread adoption.

## Question
Which word, if inserted in the blank in Text 1, would create the strongest tension between the two passages' perspectives on medical imaging technology?

## Skill
Cross-Text Connections

## Choices
- A) sophistication
- B) limitations
- C) precision
- D) complexity

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: Would not create tension as both texts acknowledge advanced technology
- B) Correct: Creates direct tension between Text 1's criticism of traditional methods and Text 2's defense of conventional approaches
- C) Incorrect: Would align with both passages' views on imaging capabilities
- D) Incorrect: Would not address the fundamental disagreement between the passages
