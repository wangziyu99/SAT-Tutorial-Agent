## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya, Sithole, Welsh, and Dana (2024).

## Passage
While CT scanning remains the gold standard for diagnostic imaging, the medical community has begun to _____ its reliance on this technology, particularly given mounting concerns about radiation exposure. Recent studies indicate that repeated CT scans may contribute to cumulative radiation risks, especially in younger patients. Despite its superior image resolution and rapid processing capabilities, the technology's potential long-term effects have prompted healthcare providers to explore alternative imaging modalities. This shift reflects a broader paradigm in medical imaging, where practitioners must balance diagnostic precision against patient safety considerations. The challenge lies in maintaining high standards of care while adapting to emerging evidence about imaging technologies' implications for public health.

## Question
Which choice best completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

## Skill
Words in Context

## Choices
- A) reexamine
- B) reconfigure
- C) reassess
- D) reevaluate

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: While "reexamine" suggests review, it implies a more theoretical analysis rather than the practical reassessment described in the passage
- B) Incorrect: "Reconfigure" suggests structural change, which is too strong given the passage's focus on gradual evaluation and adjustment
- C) Correct: "Reassess" precisely captures the medical community's active process of evaluating and potentially modifying their use of CT technology while considering both benefits and risks
- D) Incorrect: "Reevaluate" is similar to "reassess" but lacks the connotation of systematic analysis implied by the passage's discussion of evidence-based decision-making
