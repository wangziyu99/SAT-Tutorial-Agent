## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya et al. (2024), published in the Journal of Medical Physics.

## Passage
Three primary Doppler techniques are currently employed in echocardiography: pulsed wave (PW) Doppler, continuous wave (CW) Doppler, and color flow (CF) Doppler imaging. Color flow imaging interprets Doppler flow information through a directional color display system, commonly remembered through the acronym BARTâ€”blue away, red toward. Unlike CW Doppler, PW Doppler operates through intermittent transmission and reception of ultrasound pulses. The transducer's multiple crystals emit brief, concentrated bursts of ultrasound waves, followed by designated "listening" periods for detecting reflected signals. This temporal separation allows for _____, as signals from superficial structures return more quickly than those from deeper tissues. This distinctive feature enables precise depth-specific signal processing, facilitating the evaluation of multiple blood vessels positioned at different anatomical depths.

## Question
Which choice best explains what the temporal separation between transmission and reception allows for in PW Doppler, based on evidence from the passage?

## Skill
Command of Evidence (Textual, Quantitative)

## Choices
- A) enhanced signal amplification and noise reduction
- B) differential timing of signal returns
- C) increased penetration of ultrasound waves
- D) improved transducer crystal sensitivity

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: The passage doesn't mention signal amplification or noise reduction.
- B) Correct: The passage explicitly states that "signals from superficial structures return more quickly than those from deeper tissues," indicating that temporal separation allows for differential timing of signal returns.
- C) Incorrect: While penetration is implied, it's not specifically linked to temporal separation.
- D) Incorrect: The passage doesn't discuss improved crystal sensitivity as a benefit of temporal separation.
