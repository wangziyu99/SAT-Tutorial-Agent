## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024).

## Passage
Modern plant breeding has been revolutionized by the use of molecular markers, which are specific DNA segments that help identify desired genetic traits in plants. These markers serve as signposts in a plant's DNA, indicating the presence of beneficial genes. For example, in soybean plants, breeders can use molecular markers to detect the Rag1 gene, which provides resistance against harmful aphids. This method is more efficient than traditional breeding techniques, which would require exposing plants to aphids and observing their response. Without molecular markers, breeders would need to wait for visible signs of resistance, making the breeding process longer and more complicated.

## Question
Which choice best states the main idea of the passage?

## Skill
Central Ideas and Details

## Choices
- A) Molecular markers are DNA tools that make plant breeding more efficient by identifying desired genes
- B) Soybean plants can be made resistant to aphids through genetic modification
- C) Traditional plant breeding methods are no longer useful in modern agriculture
- D) The Rag1 gene is the most important discovery in plant breeding history

## Answer
- A) Correct: This accurately captures the passage's main focus on molecular markers and their role in improving plant breeding efficiency
- B) Incorrect: This is just an example used to illustrate the broader concept of molecular markers
- C) Incorrect: The passage doesn't make this claim and only mentions traditional methods for comparison
- D) Incorrect: While the Rag1 gene is mentioned, it's only used as an example and isn't presented as particularly historic
