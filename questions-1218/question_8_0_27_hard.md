## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya, Sithole, Welsh, and Dana (2024).

## Passage
The complex interaction between ultrasound waves and biological tissue _____ one of the most fascinating aspects of medical imaging. While the fundamental principles of acoustic physics remain constant, their application in clinical settings requires a nuanced understanding of how different tissue densities and interfaces affect wave propagation. This phenomenon, which has been extensively studied since the 1950s, continues to challenge researchers as they develop more sophisticated imaging techniques. The behavior of these waves, particularly at tissue boundaries where acoustic impedance changes dramatically, determines the quality and accuracy of the resulting diagnostic images.

## Question
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English while maintaining the academic tone of the passage?

## Skill
Form, Structure, and Sense

## Choices
- A) represent
- B) represents
- C) are representing
- D) have represented

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: The singular subject "interaction" requires a singular verb
- B) Correct: "Represents" agrees with the singular subject "interaction" and maintains the present simple tense appropriate for stating a general truth
- C) Incorrect: The present continuous tense is inappropriate for expressing a permanent characteristic
- D) Incorrect: The present perfect tense is inappropriate for expressing this ongoing truth
