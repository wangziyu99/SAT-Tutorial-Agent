## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024), discussing mutation breeding in rice cultivation.

## Passage
Plant breeders have developed innovative methods to create improved crop varieties. One notable example is the development of Calrose 76, a rice cultivar created through mutation breeding. Scientists began with the original Calrose variety and exposed its seeds to different levels of radiation. This approach offered a significant advantage: when using an established cultivar as the starting point, researchers sometimes discover mutations that create an immediately viable new variety without requiring additional breeding steps. However, this isn't always the case. Often, plants with desired mutations may have other unwanted traits, requiring further breeding work to develop a successful new variety. In the Calrose project, researchers treated over 2,000 seeds with varying doses of radiation to identify beneficial mutations.

## Question
Which choice best states the main idea of the text?

## Skill
Central Ideas and Details

## Choices
- A) The process of mutation breeding can create new crop varieties either directly or through additional breeding steps
- B) The Calrose 76 rice variety was developed using radiation treatment
- C) Scientists must be careful when using radiation in plant breeding
- D) Plant breeding requires treating thousands of seeds with radiation

## Answer
- A) Correct: This captures the main idea of how mutation breeding can either produce immediate results or require additional steps
- B) Incorrect: This is a supporting detail, not the main idea
- C) Incorrect: While safety might be important, it's not discussed in the passage
- D) Incorrect: This is a specific detail about one project, not the main idea
