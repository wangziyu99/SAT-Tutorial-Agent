## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Arbin Thapaliya, Alec Sithole, Michael Welsh, and Gaston Dana (2024).

## Passage
The fundamental principle underlying ultrasound technology lies in the remarkable properties of piezoelectric materials. These specialized substances generate electrical charges when subjected to mechanical stressâ€”a phenomenon known as the piezoelectric effect. This bidirectional relationship manifests inversely as well: when an electric field is applied, these materials undergo precise structural deformations. The versatility of piezoelectric materials extends beyond synthetic compounds like barium titanate and lithium niobate; remarkably, organic structures including bones, tendons, and certain polymers exhibit this property. The materials' response patterns vary according to frequency and morphology, producing distinct vibration modes that form the foundation for specialized transducer development. This intricate interplay between electrical and mechanical properties enables ultrasound devices to both generate acoustic waves and detect their echoes, transforming mechanical energy into electrical signals with extraordinary precision.
