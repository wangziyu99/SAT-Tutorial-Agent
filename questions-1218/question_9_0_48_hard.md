## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" (2024) by Thapaliya, Sithole, Welsh, and Dana.

## Passage
While researching portable ultrasound technology, a student has taken the following notes:

1. Modern ultrasound devices have evolved dramatically in size and capability, revolutionizing point-of-care diagnostics.

2. Traditional cart-based systems are being replaced by three distinct categories of portable devices, each serving different clinical needs.

3. The largest portable category consists of laptop-sized units (12-15 pounds), offering comprehensive functionality similar to traditional systems.

4. Mid-sized units (6-10 pounds) provide a balance between portability and capability, while maintaining professional-grade image quality.

5. The newest innovation is handheld devices weighing under one pound, which can connect directly to smartphones or tablets, dramatically reducing costs from $50,000+ to approximately $6,000.

## Question
The student wants to emphasize how technological advancement has made ultrasound more accessible to medical practitioners. Which choice most effectively uses the information from the notes to accomplish this goal?

## Skill
Rhetorical Synthesis

## Choices
- A) The evolution from cart-based systems to three categories of portable devices shows increasing mobility in ultrasound technology
- B) The development of lightweight handheld devices that connect to smartphones has significantly reduced both the cost and size barriers to ultrasound adoption
- C) Modern ultrasound devices have evolved to include laptop-sized units that maintain the functionality of traditional systems
- D) Mid-sized portable ultrasound units provide a compromise between mobility and imaging capability

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: While this addresses the mobility aspect, it doesn't fully capture the accessibility improvements
- B) Correct: This choice most effectively synthesizes the technological advancement (size reduction) with increased accessibility (cost reduction and ease of use)
- C) Incorrect: This focuses only on one category and doesn't address accessibility
- D) Incorrect: This describes only one category's features without addressing the broader accessibility implications
