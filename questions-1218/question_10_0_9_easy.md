## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024).

## Passage
Plant breeding techniques vary significantly across different species. Some plants naturally resist self-pollination through biological mechanisms like self-incompatibility or male sterility. _____ cross-pollination occurs frequently in these species, often facilitated by wind or insects. This natural process makes it easier for botanists to identify hybrid plants from self-pollinated ones. For certain species like alfalfa and red clover, breeders typically employ a method called polycross, where multiple parent plants contribute to creating a diverse population for selection.

## Question
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

## Skill
Transitions

## Choices
- A) Instead,
- B) However,
- C) For example,
- D) As a result,

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: "Instead" suggests a contrast that isn't present between the sentences.
- B) Incorrect: "However" implies a contradiction that doesn't exist in the context.
- C) Incorrect: The second sentence isn't providing an example of the first.
- D) Correct: The natural cross-pollination is a direct result of the plants' resistance to self-pollination, making this the most logical transition.
