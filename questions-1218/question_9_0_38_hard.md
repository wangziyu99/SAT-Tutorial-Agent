## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Arbin Thapaliya, Alec Sithole, Michael Welsh, and Gaston Dana (2024).

## Passage
While conducting research on ultrasound technology, a student has recorded these notes:

1. Modern ultrasound imaging relies on piezoelectric crystals that convert electrical energy into high-frequency sound waves and vice versa.

2. Unlike X-rays and CT scans, ultrasound imaging doesn't use ionizing radiation, making it particularly safe for fetal monitoring and repeated examinations.

3. The reflection of ultrasound waves varies based on tissue density differences, with greater differences producing stronger echoes, enabling detailed soft tissue visualization.

4. Recent developments in 3D and 4D ultrasound technology have revolutionized diagnostic capabilities, particularly in obstetrics, where real-time fetal movement can be observed.

## Question
The student wants to explain to medical professionals why ultrasound technology represents a significant advancement in diagnostic imaging. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?

## Skill
Rhetorical Synthesis

## Choices
- A) The use of piezoelectric crystals in ultrasound imaging demonstrates how electrical energy can be converted into sound waves
- B) Ultrasound technology combines safety and versatility by avoiding ionizing radiation while providing detailed soft tissue visualization through echo detection
- C) The development of 3D and 4D ultrasound has made it possible to observe fetal movement in real-time
- D) Ultrasound imaging produces stronger echoes when there are greater differences in tissue density

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: Focuses too narrowly on technical details without addressing the broader significance
- B) Correct: Effectively synthesizes multiple key advantages (safety and imaging capability) that would be relevant to medical professionals
- C) Incorrect: While true, this focuses on only one specific application rather than the broader significance
- D) Incorrect: States a technical fact without connecting it to the technology's broader importance in medical diagnostics
