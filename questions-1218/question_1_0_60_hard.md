## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya, Sithole, Welsh, and Dana (2024).

## Passage
The precision of gestational dating remains a critical concern in prenatal care, where timing can _______ medical outcomes. For preterm cases, delaying delivery often correlates with decreased infant mortality rates, while in post-term scenarios, extending pregnancy beyond ten days after the estimated delivery date may introduce unnecessary complications. The challenge intensifies when considering patients with limited prenatal care history or those who seek medical attention only at the onset of labor. Even with regular prenatal ultrasound monitoring, the accuracy of gestational dating exhibits notable variability, primarily influenced by the developmental stage at which the initial scan is performed. Traditional medical literature suggests that gestational dating accuracy fluctuates within an 8% margin of the pregnancy's actual maturation point.

## Question
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

## Skill
Words in Context

## Choices
- A) fundamentally alter
- B) marginally impact
- C) systematically document
- D) arbitrarily determine

## Answer
- A) Correct: This choice best captures the significant and transformative relationship between timing and medical outcomes in prenatal care.
- B) Incorrect: "Marginally impact" understates the crucial role of timing in prenatal outcomes.
- C) Incorrect: "Systematically document" shifts focus to record-keeping rather than the causal relationship between timing and outcomes.
- D) Incorrect: "Arbitrarily determine" suggests randomness, contradicting the systematic nature of the relationship described.
