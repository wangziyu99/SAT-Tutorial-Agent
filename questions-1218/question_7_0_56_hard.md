## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Arbin Thapaliya, Alec Sithole, Michael Welsh, and Gaston Dana (2024).

## Passage
Obstetric ultrasound technology has revolutionized our understanding of fetal development ___ allowing medical professionals to observe intricate developmental changes from the earliest stages of pregnancy. The process reveals a fascinating progression that occurs within a precise temporal framework. During these critical developmental periods, various organs undergo complex differentiation processes that are entirely time-dependent. What makes obstetric ultrasound particularly challenging is that normal findings at one gestational stage may be considered abnormal at another, requiring practitioners to possess detailed knowledge of expected developmental milestones at specific gestational ages.

## Question
Which choice most effectively connects the two independent clauses while maintaining the formal, academic tone of the passage?

## Skill
Boundaries

## Choices
- A) by
- B) which is
- C) and therefore
- D) while

## Answer
- A) Correct: "By" creates a logical relationship between the two independent clauses, showing how ultrasound serves as the means through which observation occurs.
- B) Incorrect: "Which is" creates a relative clause that makes the sentence grammatically incorrect.
- C) Incorrect: "And therefore" suggests a cause-and-effect relationship that isn't logically supported by the content.
- D) Incorrect: "While" suggests a contrast or concurrent action that doesn't accurately reflect the relationship between the clauses.
