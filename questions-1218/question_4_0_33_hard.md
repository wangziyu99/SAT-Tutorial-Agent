## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Arbin Thapaliya, Alec Sithole, Michael Welsh, and Gaston Dana (2024).

## Passage
The Doppler effect in medical ultrasound represents a sophisticated application of wave physics in diagnostic medicine. When ultrasound waves encounter moving blood cells, the frequency of the reflected waves changes in proportion to the cells' velocity. This phenomenon, known as the Doppler shift, is quantified through a complex relationship involving multiple variables: the original frequency of the transmitted wave, the velocity of the blood cells, and the angle at which the ultrasound beam intersects the blood flow. The shift's magnitude provides crucial information about blood flow velocity, while its polarity indicates directional flowâ€”positive values signify movement toward the transducer, negative values indicate movement away. In cardiac applications, physicians typically assume the angle of intersection to be either directly aligned or opposed (0 or 180 degrees) to simplify calculations and maintain diagnostic accuracy.
