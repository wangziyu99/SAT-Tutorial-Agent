## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024).

## Passage
The pistachio tree presents a fascinating example of specialized plant reproduction. Unlike many common fruit trees, pistachios have separate male and female trees, each producing their own distinct flowers. Commercial growers must carefully manage pollination to ensure a successful crop. The female trees produce clusters of small, delicate flowers that await pollen from their male counterparts. Interestingly, male trees typically bloom earlier in the season than females. To address this timing mismatch, farmers collect pollen from male flowers when available and store it in cool conditions until female flowers are ready. This careful timing and storage process helps maximize crop yields and maintain genetic diversity in pistachio orchards. Without such careful management, natural wind pollination alone would be far less efficient for commercial production.

## Question
Which choice best describes the main purpose of this passage?

## Skill
Text Structure and Purpose

## Choices
- A) To explain how commercial pistachio growers manage pollination challenges
- B) To compare male and female pistachio trees
- C) To argue for better farming practices in pistachio orchards
- D) To describe the history of pistachio cultivation

## Answer
- A) Correct: The passage primarily focuses on explaining how growers handle the challenges of pistachio pollination in commercial settings.
- B) Incorrect: While the passage mentions differences between male and female trees, this is not the main purpose but rather supports the larger explanation of pollination management.
- C) Incorrect: The passage is informative rather than argumentative and doesn't advocate for specific farming practices.
- D) Incorrect: The passage doesn't discuss the history of pistachio cultivation at all.
