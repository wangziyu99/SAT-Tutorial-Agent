## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Arbin Thapaliya, Alec Sithole, Michael Welsh, and Gaston Dana (2024).

## Passage
The shoulder joint presents unique challenges for ultrasound evaluation, requiring precise positioning and systematic examination protocols. When conducting a comprehensive assessment of the rotator cuff ___ the practitioner must evaluate multiple anatomical structures in both transverse and longitudinal planes. This includes careful examination of the subscapularis, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor muscles. Dynamic maneuvers may be necessary to assess the biceps brachii for potential subluxation or impingement. Additionally, thorough evaluation should encompass the acromioclavicular joint and the suprascapular nerve pathway through both the suprascapular and spinoglenoid notches.

## Question
Which choice most effectively combines the two sentences at the underlined portion?

## Skill
Boundaries

## Choices
- A) evaluation, as
- B) evaluation;
- C) evaluation, and
- D) evaluation, while

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: Using "as" creates a temporal relationship that isn't accurate for these independent ideas
- B) Correct: A semicolon correctly joins two related independent clauses
- C) Incorrect: The comma creates a comma splice between two independent clauses
- D) Incorrect: "While" suggests simultaneity that isn't logical in this context
