## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya, Sithole, Welsh, and Dana (2024).

## Passage
In medical imaging, the interpretation of ultrasound artifacts requires sophisticated understanding of wave physics. When ultrasound waves encounter highly reflective interfaces, they can produce distinctive patterns that either enhance or obscure diagnostic information. The most intriguing of these phenomena occurs when _________. This effect, while potentially confounding for novice practitioners, actually provides experienced sonographers with valuable diagnostic information about tissue composition and structural abnormalities. Recent advances in imaging technology have allowed researchers to distinguish between artifact-induced patterns and genuine anatomical features with unprecedented precision, though the fundamental physics underlying these interactions remains unchanged.

## Question
Which choice most logically completes the text?

## Skill
Inferences

## Choices
- A) multiple wave reflections create a cascading series of diminishing echoes
- B) sound waves disperse randomly through heterogeneous tissue
- C) acoustic impedance varies between different tissue types
- D) digital processing algorithms filter out unwanted signals

## Answer
- A) Correct: This choice correctly describes the physical mechanism that creates the distinctive pattern mentioned in the passage, and aligns with both the technical context and the passage's discussion of wave reflection and diagnostic value.
- B) Incorrect: Random dispersion would not create the distinctive patterns referenced in the passage and contradicts the organized nature of the phenomenon being described.
- C) Incorrect: While acoustic impedance variation is relevant to ultrasound imaging, it doesn't specifically explain the phenomenon of pattern creation discussed in the passage.
- D) Incorrect: Digital processing is a post-imaging consideration and doesn't explain the physical phenomenon being described in the passage.
