## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024).

## Passage
Plant breeders must carefully consider their approach when developing new crop varieties. Traditional breeding methods require significant time investment to achieve desired traits. _____ modern genetic techniques have accelerated the process considerably. Using molecular markers, breeders can now identify desired traits more quickly and efficiently than ever before. This advancement has transformed what was once a lengthy trial-and-error process into a more precise science. The ability to screen plants at the genetic level has dramatically reduced the time needed to develop new varieties.

## Question
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

## Skill
Transitions

## Choices
- A) However,
- B) Similarly,
- C) Therefore,
- D) For instance,

## Answer
- A) Correct: This transition word correctly signals the contrast between traditional time-consuming breeding methods and faster modern techniques.
- B) Incorrect: "Similarly" suggests the modern techniques are like traditional methods, which contradicts the passage's meaning.
- C) Incorrect: "Therefore" implies the modern techniques are a result of traditional methods, which is not logically supported.
- D) Incorrect: "For instance" suggests an example is being given, but the sentence introduces a new, contrasting idea instead.
