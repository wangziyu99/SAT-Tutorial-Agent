## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Arbin Thapaliya, Alec Sithole, Michael Welsh, and Gaston Dana (2024).

## Passage
Recent advances in medical imaging technology _____ revolutionized our understanding of musculoskeletal pathologies, particularly in the diagnosis of biceps tendon injuries. The precision with which modern ultrasound equipment can visualize anatomical structures, combined with its real-time imaging capabilities, has transformed diagnostic protocols. While traditional imaging modalities remain valuable, the dynamic nature of ultrasound examination, allowing for both static and kinetic assessment of tissue structures, presents unique advantages. The methodology's efficacy, however, depends heavily on the operator's expertise and the systematic approach to visualization, particularly when examining complex anatomical relationships such as those found in the shoulder joint.

## Question
Which choice best completes the text so that it maintains logical cohesion while conforming to the conventions of Standard English?

## Skill
Form, Structure, and Sense

## Choices
- A) has
- B) have
- C) having
- D) had

## Answer
- A) Correct: "Has" is correct because the compound subject "advances" is treated as a singular unit when referring to a collective development or progress.
- B) Incorrect: "Have" would be incorrect as the subject "advances" is being treated as a singular concept rather than multiple separate events.
- C) Incorrect: "Having" would create a participial phrase without a main verb, resulting in an incomplete sentence.
- D) Incorrect: "Had" would shift the temporal focus to the past perfect tense, which doesn't align with the passage's discussion of current technological capabilities.
