## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya et al. (2024), discussing the fundamental components and functionality of ultrasound imaging systems.

## Passage
Modern ultrasound imaging has revolutionized diagnostic medicine through its non-invasive approach to visualizing internal structures. The technology relies on sophisticated equipment to process and interpret sound waves. _____ these machines are highly advanced, they still face certain limitations in image quality. Artifacts can emerge from various sources, including tissue interfaces and equipment calibration. The core components of an ultrasound system work in concert to minimize these issues: the transducer generates and receives sound waves through piezoelectric materials, while the central processing unit interprets these signals. The pulse controls allow technicians to adjust frequency and amplitude parameters, ensuring optimal image resolution for different tissue types.

## Question
Which choice best completes the text with the most logical transition?

## Skill
Transitions

## Choices
- A) Although
- B) Because
- C) Moreover,
- D) Subsequently,

## Answer
- A) Correct: This transition effectively sets up the contrast between the advanced nature of ultrasound machines and their continuing limitations.
- B) Incorrect: This would incorrectly suggest that the machines' advanced nature causes their limitations.
- C) Incorrect: This additive transition doesn't capture the contrasting relationship between the two ideas.
- D) Incorrect: This sequential transition doesn't appropriately connect the ideas, as the limitations aren't a result of the advancement.
