## Abstract
The following texts are excerpted from "Advances in Medical Imaging Technology" (2024) by Dr. Sarah Chen and "Clinical Applications of Ultrasound" (2023) by Dr. James Roberts.

## Passage
Text 1:
Recent advances in ultrasound technology have revolutionized medical imaging through dimensional progression. While two-dimensional ultrasound remains the clinical standard, providing real-time cross-sectional images of anatomical structures, three-dimensional ultrasound reconstruction offers volumetric visualization that enhances diagnostic accuracy. The integration of time as the fourth dimension (4D) enables dynamic assessment of moving structures, particularly valuable in fetal medicine and cardiac imaging.

Text 2:
Despite the apparent advantages of advanced imaging modalities, the clinical implementation of 3D/4D ultrasound faces significant challenges. The substantial cost of equipment acquisition and maintenance, extended examination times, and the requirement for specialized operator training have limited widespread adoption. Additionally, the clinical benefit of these advanced techniques over conventional 2D imaging remains debatable in certain diagnostic scenarios.

## Question
How would the author of Text 1 most likely respond to the concerns raised in Text 2?

## Skill
Cross-Text Connections

## Choices
- A) Dismissal, arguing that the technological benefits outweigh any practical limitations
- B) Acknowledgment, while maintaining that the diagnostic advantages justify the implementation challenges
- C) Agreement, conceding that the limitations make the technology impractical for widespread use
- D) Indifference, as the focus is solely on technological capabilities rather than clinical implementation

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: Too extreme given the measured tone of Text 1
- B) Correct: Text 1's emphasis on the revolutionary nature and enhanced diagnostic capabilities suggests the author would acknowledge but justify overcoming the challenges
- C) Incorrect: Contradicts Text 1's positive stance on the technology's value
- D) Incorrect: Text 1 discusses clinical applications, indicating concern for implementation
