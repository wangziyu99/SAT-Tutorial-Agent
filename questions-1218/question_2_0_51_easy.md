## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024).

## Passage
Plant breeders have developed various methods to improve crop varieties over time. One common approach involves a technique called polycross breeding, where multiple plant varieties are grown together in isolation. In this method, plants naturally cross-pollinate through wind action, allowing breeders to observe how different varieties combine their traits. The resulting seeds from each plant contain genetic material from both the mother plant and various potential father plants in the field. This process helps scientists identify which plants have the best "combining ability" - that is, which varieties produce the most successful offspring when crossed with others. By studying these offspring, breeders can select the most promising parent plants for future breeding programs.

## Question
Which choice best describes the main purpose of this passage?

## Skill
Text Structure and Purpose

## Choices
- A) To explain how a specific plant breeding technique works and its benefits
- B) To compare different methods of plant breeding
- C) To argue for the superiority of polycross breeding over other methods
- D) To describe the history of plant breeding developments

## Answer
- A) Correct: The passage focuses on explaining the polycross breeding method and its purpose in identifying plants with good combining ability
- B) Incorrect: The passage only discusses one method (polycross breeding) rather than comparing multiple methods
- C) Incorrect: The passage describes polycross breeding but doesn't argue for its superiority
- D) Incorrect: The passage explains a current technique rather than providing historical context
