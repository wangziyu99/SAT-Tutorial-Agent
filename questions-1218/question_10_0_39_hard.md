## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya et al. (2024), discussing blood flow dynamics in vessels.

## Passage
Blood flow patterns in vessels are determined by multiple factors including pressure and vessel geometry. In straight, large vessels, the flow exhibits a laminar pattern, where blood layers maintain consistent distances from vessel walls. The velocity of these layers varies based on their position and pressure gradients. _____ this orderly flow can be disrupted when blood encounters vessel branches or irregularities, potentially creating turbulent patterns that affect circulation efficiency. The transition from laminar to turbulent flow occurs when the Reynolds number, a measure of flow characteristics, exceeds a critical threshold. This phenomenon has significant implications for cardiovascular health, as turbulent flow can increase resistance and strain on vessel walls.

## Question
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

## Skill
Transitions

## Choices
- A) Nevertheless,
- B) Similarly,
- C) However,
- D) Furthermore,

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: "Nevertheless" implies a contrast that doesn't exist between the preceding and following statements
- B) Incorrect: "Similarly" suggests a parallel relationship, but the text shifts from describing laminar flow to its disruption
- C) Correct: "However" appropriately signals the contrast between orderly laminar flow and its potential disruption
- D) Incorrect: "Furthermore" suggests additional supporting information rather than the contrasting idea presented
