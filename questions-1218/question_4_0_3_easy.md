## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024).

## Passage
Plant introductions (PIs) in the United States are managed by the National Genetic Resources Program (NGRP), which oversees the acquisition, preservation, and distribution of plant germplasm from both domestic and international sources. Through their online database at www.ars-grin.gov, researchers can access descriptions of available plant materials and request samples. These plant introductions have proven invaluable to breeding programs, providing new genes for crucial traits such as insect and disease resistance, and improved seed quality. Breeders frequently turn to plant introductions when searching for traits absent in current elite cultivars. Currently, the NGRP provides these plant materials free of charge, asking only that recipients share their evaluation results.

## Question
Which choice best states the main idea of the text?

## Skill
Central Ideas and Details

## Choices
- A) The NGRP manages a valuable system of plant introductions that provides free genetic resources to support breeding programs
- B) Plant introductions are primarily used to develop disease resistance in crops
- C) The NGRP's website contains detailed information about plant genetics
- D) Researchers must share their findings when using plant introductions

## Answer
- A) Correct: This choice accurately captures the central focus of the passage - the NGRP's role in managing plant introductions and their value to breeding programs
- B) Incorrect: While disease resistance is mentioned, it's just one example of many traits
- C) Incorrect: The website is mentioned only briefly and is not the main focus
- D) Incorrect: Sharing results is mentioned only as a minor detail at the end of the passage
