## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024), discussing experimental procedures in mutation breeding.

## Passage
The use of five dosages increased the chance of finding one dosage that would result in an adequate mutation frequency. The use of a control treatment made it possible to assess how each of the dosages influenced germination and the frequency of mutation. Before treatment, the seeds were brought to 14% moisture. Adjustment of moisture would be considered a pretreatment. It is assumed that the breeder had some prior knowledge that this step would be useful when using cobalt-60 radiation. The M1 seeds were planted in the field. Although rice is self-pollinated, the M1 plants were isolated by 11 m from untreated rice genotypes to prevent outcrossing. ________

## Question
Which quotation from the passage best supports the idea that the experiment was designed to compare different treatment effects?

## Skill
Command of Evidence (Textual, Quantitative)

## Choices
A) "The use of five dosages increased the chance of finding one dosage that would result in an adequate mutation frequency."
B) "Before treatment, the seeds were brought to 14% moisture."
C) "The M1 seeds were planted in the field."
D) "Although rice is self-pollinated, the M1 plants were isolated by 11 m from untreated rice genotypes"

## Answer
A) Correct: This quote directly shows how multiple dosages were used to compare and find the most effective treatment.
B) Incorrect: This quote describes a preparation step but doesn't address comparing treatments.
C) Incorrect: This quote simply states a procedural step without mentioning treatment comparison.
D) Incorrect: This quote describes a precautionary measure but doesn't relate to treatment comparison.
