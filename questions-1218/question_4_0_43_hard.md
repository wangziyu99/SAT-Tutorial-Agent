## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Arbin Thapaliya, Alec Sithole, Michael Welsh, and Gaston Dana (2024).

## Passage
While three- and four-dimensional clinical ultrasounds have existed for nearly a quarter century, their adoption has been notably slower than that of computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), primarily due to challenges in three-dimensional data rendering. Recent advances in computing power, however, have revolutionized ultrasound technology by enabling complex signal processing essential for 3D visualization. Three-dimensional ultrasound builds upon traditional 2D principles but incorporates position-sensing elements to generate volumetric images. This advancement represents ___________ in medical imaging, though 2D ultrasound remains prevalent in clinical settings due to its accessibility and established protocols. The evolution from 2D to 4D technology, which displays 3D images in motion, exemplifies the field's trajectory toward increasingly sophisticated diagnostic capabilities.

## Question
Which choice most effectively completes the text while maintaining the passage's analytical tone and supporting its central argument about technological progression in ultrasound imaging?

## Skill
Central Ideas and Details

## Choices
- A) an incremental yet significant paradigm shift
- B) a revolutionary breakthrough in visualization
- C) the future of diagnostic medicine
- D) modern technological innovation

## Answer
- A) Correct: This choice best captures the gradual but important nature of the advancement while maintaining the passage's measured, analytical tone.
- B) Incorrect: Too dramatic given the passage's emphasis on slow adoption and building upon existing principles.
- C) Incorrect: Too broad and forward-looking for a passage focused on specific technological development.
- D) Incorrect: Too generic and lacks the specific context of the progression in ultrasound technology.
