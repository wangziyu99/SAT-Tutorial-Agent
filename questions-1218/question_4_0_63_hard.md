## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya et al. (2024).

## Passage
In musculoskeletal ultrasound imaging, the relationship between transducer selection and structural visualization is _____. For instance, when examining intricate anatomical features like the digital pulley system, high-frequency transducers exceeding 10 MHz offer superior resolution. This precision becomes particularly crucial as practitioners navigate the complex interplay between acoustic physics and tissue composition. The methodology requires careful attention to the angle of insonation, particularly when imaging bony surfaces, which present as hyperechoic structures. This approach helps minimize anisotropy - a phenomenon that can significantly distort image quality. The characteristic appearance of different anatomical structures further complicates the imaging process, with tendons displaying a distinctive hyperechoic fibrillar pattern in longitudinal views, while ligaments exhibit a more condensed echogenic signature.
