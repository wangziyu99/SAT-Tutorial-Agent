## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya et al. (2024), discussing various Doppler ultrasound techniques and their medical applications.

## Passage
Different Doppler ultrasound techniques serve distinct diagnostic purposes in medical imaging. While the Pulsed-Wave (PW) Doppler excels at measuring precise locations but struggles with high velocities, the Continuous-Wave (CW) Doppler operates differently. The CW method _____________. This limitation means that while it can measure high-velocity blood flow with exceptional accuracy, it cannot provide detailed anatomical imaging or depth-specific measurements. Meanwhile, Color Flow (CF) Doppler combines aspects of both techniques, enabling visualization of blood flow patterns across a two-dimensional cardiac image through multiple sampling gates.

## Question
Which choice most logically completes the text based on the information provided about Doppler ultrasound techniques?

## Skill
Inferences

## Choices
- A) employs dual crystals that simultaneously transmit and receive ultrasound waves continuously
- B) creates detailed anatomical images through multiple sampling points
- C) measures blood flow at specific depths using pulsed wave transmission
- D) combines both continuous and pulsed wave techniques for optimal imaging

## Answer
- A) Correct: This choice logically explains how CW Doppler works, consistent with its described capabilities and limitations.
- B) Incorrect: Contradicts the passage's statement that CW Doppler cannot create anatomical images.
- C) Incorrect: Describes PW Doppler's capabilities, not CW Doppler's characteristics.
- D) Incorrect: Misrepresents CW Doppler by suggesting it combines both techniques, which isn't supported by the passage.
