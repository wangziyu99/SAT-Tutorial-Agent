## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Arbin Thapaliya, Alec Sithole, Michael Welsh, and Gaston Dana (2024).

## Passage
Blood flow dynamics plays a crucial role in understanding vascular diseases_ such as atherosclerosis and thrombosis. The circulatory system's primary functions include transporting nutrients and waste throughout the body while maintaining optimal temperature and pH levels. This complex network consists of the heart which acts as the central pump, directing blood through an intricate system of vessels to sustain cellular health. Recent advances in duplex ultrasonography have revolutionized our ability to visualize these processes by combining Doppler shift frequencies with high-resolution B-mode imaging providing both physiological and anatomical data simultaneously.

## Choices
- A) Blood flow dynamics plays a crucial role in understanding vascular diseases, such as
- B) Blood flow dynamics plays a crucial role in understanding vascular diseases: such as
- C) Blood flow dynamics plays a crucial role in understanding vascular diseases; such as
- D) Blood flow dynamics plays a crucial role in understanding vascular diseases such as

## Answer
- A) Correct: This is the correct choice as it properly uses a comma before the phrase "such as" to introduce examples.
- B) Incorrect: A colon is inappropriate here as the following information provides examples rather than a complete explanation.
- C) Incorrect: A semicolon is incorrect as it should separate two independent clauses, which is not the case here.
- D) Incorrect: Omitting punctuation before "such as" when introducing examples is incorrect in formal writing.
