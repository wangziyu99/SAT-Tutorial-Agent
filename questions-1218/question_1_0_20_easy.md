## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024).

## Passage
Growing plants requires careful attention to environmental conditions. In our greenhouse facility, we maintain precise control over temperature and lighting to ensure optimal plant development. The seedlings _____ under carefully regulated conditions: 16 hours of light at 22°C and 8 hours of darkness at 16°C. This controlled environment allows researchers to monitor plant growth consistently throughout the year, regardless of outdoor weather conditions.

## Question
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

## Skill
Words in Context

## Choices
- A) flourish
- B) develop
- C) exist
- D) survive

## Answer
- A) Correct: "Flourish" is the most precise choice as it implies both growth and successful development under favorable conditions, which matches the context of the carefully controlled environment described in the passage.
- B) Incorrect: While "develop" is related to growth, it's more neutral and doesn't capture the positive nature of the controlled conditions.
- C) Incorrect: "Exist" is too basic and doesn't convey any sense of growth or development.
- D) Incorrect: "Survive" implies merely staying alive despite challenges, which contradicts the optimal growing conditions described.
