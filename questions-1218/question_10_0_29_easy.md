## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024).

## Passage
Scientists have developed new methods to identify specific genetic traits in plants. DNA analysis reveals distinct patterns in plant genetics through molecular markers. ___ these markers help researchers track important traits like disease resistance. For example, when examining soybean plants, researchers can identify specific DNA sequences that indicate resistance to certain pests. This identification process allows plant breeders to select and develop improved crop varieties more efficiently than traditional breeding methods.

## Question
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

## Skill
Transitions

## Choices
- A) However,
- B) Specifically,
- C) For instance,
- D) Consequently,

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: "However" indicates contrast, which doesn't fit the logical flow between the sentences.
- B) Incorrect: "Specifically" would be redundant since the next sentence already provides a specific example.
- C) Incorrect: "For instance" would be redundant since an example follows in the subsequent sentence.
- D) Correct: "Consequently" provides the most logical transition as it shows the cause-and-effect relationship between the development of molecular markers and their practical application in tracking traits.
