## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya, Sithole, Welsh, and Dana (2024).

## Passage
The human heart's intricate blood circulation system relies on precise timing and coordinated movement. During cardiac expansion, or diastole_ blood flows passively from the right atrium through the tricuspid valve and into the right ventricle. This process, which begins as deoxygenated blood enters through the superior and inferior vena cava, initiates a complex sequence of events. The subsequent cardiac contraction forces blood through the pulmonary artery, where it branches into increasingly smaller vessels until reaching the pulmonary capillaries. Here, critical gas exchange occurs within the alveolar sacs of the lungs.

## Question
Which choice best completes the text while maintaining proper punctuation and ensuring clear meaning?

## Skill
Boundaries

## Choices
- A) diastole,
- B) diastole:
- C) diastole;
- D) diastoleâ€”

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: A comma would create a weak boundary between related ideas that require stronger separation
- B) Incorrect: A colon suggests that what follows is a list or explanation, which isn't the case here
- C) Incorrect: A semicolon would inappropriately separate two related clauses where the second isn't independent
- D) Correct: The em dash effectively connects the main concept (diastole) with its detailed explanation while maintaining proper flow and emphasis in this complex medical description
