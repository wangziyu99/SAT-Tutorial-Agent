## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024).

## Passage
Plant breeders have developed different methods for producing crop varieties. One common approach involves pure-line cultivars, where seeds harvested in one season are used to plant commercial fields the next season. These cultivars maintain their genetic characteristics from one generation to the next. In contrast, hybrid cultivars are produced by crossing two genetically different parents, resulting in heterozygous plants. Unlike pure-line cultivars, hybrid seeds must be produced fresh each year because the harvested seeds differ genetically from the planted ones. Hybrid varieties come in several forms, including single-crosses, three-way crosses, and double crosses, each using a different number of parent lines. While single-cross hybrids produce genetically identical plants, three-way and double-cross hybrids result in plants with genetic variations.

## Question
Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?

## Skill
Text Structure and Purpose

## Choices
- A) To explain the key differences between pure-line and hybrid cultivars in plant breeding
- B) To argue for the superiority of hybrid cultivars over pure-line cultivars
- C) To describe the historical development of plant breeding methods
- D) To analyze the economic impact of different plant breeding techniques

## Answer
- A) Correct: The passage clearly focuses on explaining the fundamental differences between pure-line and hybrid cultivars, including their reproduction methods and genetic characteristics.
- B) Incorrect: The passage presents information objectively without making value judgments about which method is superior.
- C) Incorrect: While the passage discusses breeding methods, it doesn't address their historical development.
- D) Incorrect: The passage doesn't discuss economic aspects of plant breeding techniques.
