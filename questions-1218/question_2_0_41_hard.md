## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya et al. (2024).

## Passage
The clinical significance of blood flow dynamics extends beyond mere velocity measurements. When examining vascular health, physicians must consider the complex interplay between laminar and turbulent flow patterns. Under normal conditions, blood exhibits laminar flow, characterized by parallel layers moving smoothly through vessels. However, this orderly pattern can be disrupted when blood encounters vessel irregularities or changes in diameter. The transition from laminar to turbulent flow depends on several critical factors, including vessel geometry and blood viscosity. Understanding these flow dynamics has profound implications for diagnosing various cardiovascular conditions. For instance, turbulent flow patterns often indicate underlying pathologies such as stenosis or vessel malformation, while specific flow measurements can reveal crucial information about organ perfusion and vascular resistance.
