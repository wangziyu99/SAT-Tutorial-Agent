## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Modern Plant Breeding Techniques" by Dr. Sarah Chen, 2024.

## Passage
While researching plant breeding methods, a student has taken the following notes:

1. Traditional plant breeding relies on selecting plants with desired traits and cross-pollinating them over many generations.

2. Modern genetic markers help identify plants carrying specific beneficial genes without waiting for the plant to mature.

3. DNA testing allows breeders to screen thousands of seedlings in early growth stages, saving time and resources.

4. The success rate of developing new varieties has increased from 1% to 25% since the introduction of genetic screening methods.

## Question
The student wants to explain to farmers why modern breeding methods are more efficient than traditional ones. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?

## Skill
Rhetorical Synthesis

## Choices
- A) Modern breeding methods use DNA testing and genetic markers to identify beneficial traits
- B) The success rate of developing new plant varieties has significantly improved with genetic screening
- C) Traditional breeding methods require multiple generations of cross-pollination to develop new varieties
- D) Plant breeders can now test thousands of seedlings using modern methods

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: While accurate, this choice doesn't specifically address efficiency
- B) Correct: This directly demonstrates improved efficiency by citing the increased success rate from 1% to 25%
- C) Incorrect: This focuses on traditional methods rather than modern efficiency
- D) Incorrect: While true, it doesn't clearly connect to improved efficiency
