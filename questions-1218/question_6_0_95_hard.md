## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya, Sithole, Welsh, and Dana (2024).

## Passage
The venous system, a complex network of blood vessels, serves multiple critical functions in human physiology. While its primary role is returning deoxygenated blood to the heart, it also plays a crucial role in thermoregulation and blood storage, containing up to 70% of circulating blood at any given time. The system's architecture consists of three interconnected networks: superficial, perforating, and deep veins. Blood flows from superficial to deep veins through branching perforators, with deep veins typically paralleling arterial pathways. This sophisticated system relies on ___________ to maintain efficient unidirectional flow, particularly given the challenges of moving blood against gravity in a low-pressure environment.

## Question
Which choice most logically completes the text?

## Skill
Inferences

## Choices
- A) muscular contractions and specialized valves
- B) pressure gradients and vessel elasticity
- C) gravitational forces and blood viscosity
- D) neural signals and hormonal regulation

## Answer
- A) Correct: The passage discusses the low-pressure environment and the need for unidirectional flow, making muscular contractions and valves essential mechanisms for blood movement.
- B) Incorrect: While pressure gradients exist, they alone wouldn't be sufficient in a "low-pressure environment" as mentioned in the passage.
- C) Incorrect: Gravitational forces actually oppose venous return and aren't a mechanism that aids flow.
- D) Incorrect: While these systems play a role in circulation, they're not the primary mechanical means of ensuring unidirectional flow in veins.
