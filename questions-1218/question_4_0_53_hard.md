## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya et al. (2024).

## Passage
The implementation of diagnostic ultrasound technology demands a nuanced understanding of its bioeffects and safety protocols. While ultrasound imaging has revolutionized medical diagnostics, its application requires strict adherence to established guidelines that prioritize patient safety while maintaining diagnostic efficacy. The operator's expertise must encompass not only technical proficiency but also a comprehensive awareness of how machine settings influence both thermal and mechanical effects on biological tissues. The principle of "As Low As Reasonably Achievable" (ALARA) serves as the cornerstone of ultrasound safety protocols, mandating that power settings be optimized to achieve diagnostic quality while minimizing potential tissue exposure. This delicate balance between diagnostic utility and safety considerations underscores the complexity of modern medical imaging practices.

## Question
Which choice best captures the central tension described in the passage?

## Skill
Central Ideas and Details

## Choices
- A) The conflict between the accessibility of ultrasound technology and the expertise required to operate it
- B) The balance between achieving optimal diagnostic imaging and maintaining patient safety protocols
- C) The challenge of developing new ultrasound technologies while adhering to traditional medical practices
- D) The disparity between theoretical knowledge and practical application in medical imaging

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: The passage doesn't focus on accessibility versus expertise
- B) Correct: The passage explicitly discusses the need to balance diagnostic quality with safety considerations, particularly through the ALARA principle
- C) Incorrect: The passage doesn't address the development of new technologies
- D) Incorrect: While expertise is mentioned, the passage doesn't contrast theoretical and practical knowledge
