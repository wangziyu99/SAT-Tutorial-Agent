## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Arbin Thapaliya, Alec Sithole, Michael Welsh, and Gaston Dana (2024).

## Passage
While conducting research on fetal ultrasound imaging, a medical student has taken the following notes:

1. The clarity of ultrasound images depends significantly on amniotic fluid levels, as fluid media affects ultrasound wave transmission and reflection.

2. Excessive amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios) often makes obtaining clear ultrasound images easier due to enhanced wave transmission.

3. However, polyhydramnios is associated with high-risk pregnancies in approximately 20% of cases.

4. Standard ultrasound imaging at 23 weeks gestation allows visualization of fetal morphology, but image clarity should not be the only consideration in assessment.

## Question
The student wants to explain to medical residents why seemingly clear ultrasound images might actually indicate a concerning clinical situation. Which choice most effectively uses the information from the notes to accomplish this goal?

## Skill
Rhetorical Synthesis

## Choices
- A) Clear ultrasound images are achieved through proper transmission of sound waves through amniotic fluid
- B) While excess amniotic fluid facilitates easier imaging, its presence may signal underlying complications in 20% of cases
- C) Fetal morphology is best assessed at 23 weeks gestation when amniotic fluid levels are optimal
- D) Medical professionals should focus on both image quality and clinical indicators when performing ultrasounds

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: Focuses only on technical aspects without addressing the clinical implications
- B) Correct: Effectively connects the paradox between easy imaging and clinical concerns, using specific statistical data to support the point
- C) Incorrect: Misrepresents the notes by suggesting an optimal timing that wasn't mentioned
- D) Incorrect: Too general and doesn't specifically address the relationship between clear images and potential complications
