## Abstract
The following texts are adapted from "Modern Plant Breeding Techniques" by Dr. Sarah Chen (2024) and "Agricultural Innovation Review" by Dr. James Martinez (2024).

## Passage
Text 1:
Traditional plant breeding relies heavily on natural selection and crossbreeding of plants with desired traits. This process, while effective, can take many growing seasons to achieve desired results. Farmers must carefully select parent plants, cross-pollinate them, and then wait to observe the traits in offspring. The uncertainty of outcomes and time investment make this method challenging for addressing urgent agricultural needs.

Text 2:
Modern genetic modification techniques have revolutionized plant breeding. Using laboratory methods, scientists can now identify and transfer specific genes responsible for desired traits directly into crop plants. This process can reduce breeding time from several years to just a few months, allowing for rapid development of crops with improved resistance to diseases and environmental stresses.

## Question
How would the author of Text 1 most likely respond to the methods described in Text 2?

## Skill
Cross-Text Connections

## Choices
- A) Support, because the new techniques address the time and uncertainty challenges of traditional breeding
- B) Opposition, because traditional breeding methods are more reliable
- C) Indifference, because both methods achieve the same results
- D) Skepticism, because genetic modification is too artificial

## Answer
- A) Correct: The author of Text 1 emphasizes the challenges of time investment and uncertainty in traditional breeding, so they would likely support methods that address these specific issues
- B) Incorrect: Text 1 doesn't suggest traditional methods are more reliable; it actually highlights their limitations
- C) Incorrect: Text 1's focus on challenges suggests the author would not be indifferent to improvements
- D) Incorrect: Text 1 doesn't express any preference for natural versus artificial methods
