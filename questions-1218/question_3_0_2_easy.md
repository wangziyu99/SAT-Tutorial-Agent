## Abstract
The following texts are adapted from "Plant Breeding Ethics and Protocols" (2024) by Dr. Sarah Chen and "Agricultural Research Guidelines" (2024) by Dr. James Martinez.

## Passage
Text 1:
Plant breeders often rely on sharing genetic materials between institutions to develop improved crop varieties. This exchange of plant materials, or germplasm, has historically operated on informal agreements and professional courtesy. However, recent legal disputes have highlighted the risks of verbal agreements in germplasm exchange, particularly when valuable commercial varieties are involved.

Text 2:
The International Plant Exchange Protocol requires all germplasm transfers to be documented with written agreements. These agreements must specify the intended use, any restrictions on commercialization, and acknowledgment requirements. This standardization helps protect both the provider and recipient of genetic materials while promoting scientific collaboration.

## Question
Based on these passages, how would the author of Text 1 most likely respond to the protocol described in Text 2?

## Skill
Cross-Text Connections

## Choices
- A) Support, because it addresses the problems with informal agreements
- B) Opposition, because it makes germplasm exchange more complicated
- C) Indifference, because verbal agreements are still commonly used
- D) Confusion, because written agreements are unnecessary in scientific collaboration

## Answer
- A) Correct: Text 1 highlights the "risks of verbal agreements," suggesting the author would support Text 2's formal protocol
- B) Incorrect: Text 1 acknowledges problems with informal systems, not viewing formality as a burden
- C) Incorrect: Text 1 specifically points out problems with verbal agreements
- D) Incorrect: Text 1 implies written documentation is important by mentioning legal disputes
