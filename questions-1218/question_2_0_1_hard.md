## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Arbin Thapaliya, Alec Sithole, Michael Welsh, and Gaston Dana (2024).

## Passage
The scientific understanding of wave mechanics has revolutionized modern medical diagnostics, particularly through ultrasound technology. While conventional explanations of wave behavior often rely on simplified mechanical analogies, the underlying physical principles reveal a more nuanced interplay between energy transfer and medium displacement. The propagation of ultrasonic waves through biological tissue exemplifies this complexity, as these waves navigate through heterogeneous cellular structures, creating intricate patterns of compression and rarefaction. This process, though fundamentally similar to basic sound wave propagation, demonstrates ___________ when applied in medical imaging, where the interpretation of reflected waves must account for varying tissue densities, interface properties, and the transformation of mechanical energy into diagnostic information.

## Question

## Skill
Text Structure and Purpose

## Choices
A) unprecedented sophistication
B) remarkable effectiveness
C) heightened complexity
D) technical precision

## Answer
A) Incorrect: Too broad and emotionally charged for the analytical context
B) Incorrect: Focuses on outcomes rather than the theoretical framework being discussed
C) Correct: Best maintains the passage's analytical tone while emphasizing the theoretical progression from basic principles to complex applications
D) Incorrect: Too narrow in scope and fails to capture the broader conceptual development described in the passage
