## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya, Sithole, Welsh, and Dana (2024).

## Passage
In medical imaging, ultrasound artifacts present a significant challenge to accurate diagnosis. These distortions arise from ___________, creating deceptive images that can mislead practitioners. The beam width artifact, for instance, occurs when ultrasound waves interact simultaneously with fluid and adjacent soft tissue, causing structures to appear in incorrect locations due to side echoes being misinterpreted as part of the central beam. Similarly, reverberation artifacts emerge when sound waves become trapped between parallel reflective surfaces, producing a distinctive "staircase" pattern in the resulting image. These phenomena challenge three fundamental assumptions of ultrasound technology: that sound travels in straight lines, that echoes align parallel to the transducer axis, and that sound waves maintain a constant velocity of 1540 m/s in soft tissue.

## Question
Which choice best completes the blank while maintaining the paragraph's analytical focus and technical precision?

## Skill
Central Ideas and Details

## Choices
- A) complex wave interactions and physical limitations inherent to ultrasound technology
- B) poor equipment maintenance and operator error during imaging procedures
- C) patient movement and physiological variations during examination
- D) environmental factors and external electromagnetic interference

## Answer
- A) Correct: This choice accurately captures the technical nature of the passage and connects to the specific examples that follow
- B) Incorrect: The passage focuses on inherent physical limitations rather than maintenance or operator issues
- C) Incorrect: While patient factors can affect imaging, the passage discusses technical and physical phenomena
- D) Incorrect: The passage doesn't mention environmental or electromagnetic interference
