## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024).

## Passage
Mass selection is a plant breeding technique that can be combined with single-seed descent methods. When disease-resistant plants show visible differences from susceptible ones, breeders can collect individual seeds from the resistant plants for the next generation. However, this method isn't foolproof. In the development of Gadsby wheat, some susceptible plants may have avoided infection and produced seeds as heavy as those from resistant plants, leading to the unintentional selection of some susceptible plants for the next generation. Despite its imperfections, mass selection can effectively increase the proportion of desired traits in a plant population. It's worth noting that the term "mass selection" carries different meanings when used in inbreeding versus recurrent selection contexts.

## Question
Which quotation from the passage best supports the claim that mass selection is not a perfect breeding method?

## Skill
Command of Evidence (Textual)

## Choices
A) "Mass selection is a plant breeding technique that can be combined with single-seed descent methods."
B) "When disease-resistant plants show visible differences from susceptible ones, breeders can collect individual seeds from the resistant plants"
C) "some susceptible plants may have avoided infection and produced seeds as heavy as those from resistant plants"
D) "mass selection can effectively increase the proportion of desired traits in a plant population"

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: This quote merely defines the technique and doesn't address its limitations
- B) Incorrect: This quote describes the process but doesn't highlight any flaws
- C) Correct: This quote directly illustrates a specific example of how mass selection can fail by accidentally including undesirable traits
- D) Incorrect: This quote actually describes a benefit of mass selection, not its imperfections
