## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Arbin Thapaliya, Alec Sithole, Michael Welsh, and Gaston Dana (2024).

## Passage
Renal ultrasound imaging has revolutionized the diagnosis of kidney disorders. Advanced Doppler technology enables clinicians to measure blood flow velocity, which can indicate renal artery stenosis. _____ this specialized examination requires extensive expertise, many general ultrasound practitioners refer such cases to specialists. One particularly concerning condition that ultrasound can detect is hydronephrosis, characterized by kidney enlargement due to fluid accumulation. This condition typically results from ureteral obstruction, causing a backup of urine and subsequent renal swelling. In severe cases, the progressive pressure can lead to cortical thinning, potentially compromising kidney function.

## Question
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

## Skill
Transitions

## Choices
- A) Nevertheless,
- B) Similarly,
- C) Because
- D) Furthermore,

## Answer
- A) Correct: "Nevertheless" appropriately signals a contrast between the advanced capability of Doppler technology and the practical limitation that many practitioners need to refer these cases to specialists.
- B) Incorrect: "Similarly" implies a parallel relationship between ideas, but the text presents a contrasting relationship between capability and practical implementation.
- C) Incorrect: "Because" would indicate that the advanced technology is the reason for referrals, which illogically reverses the relationship between these ideas.
- D) Incorrect: "Furthermore" suggests an additional supporting point, but the text presents a contrasting idea about the practical limitations of implementing this technology.
