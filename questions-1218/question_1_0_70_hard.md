## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" (2024) by Thapaliya, Sithole, Welsh, and Dana.

## Passage
In musculoskeletal sonography, precise visualization of anatomical structures requires an understanding of their intricate relationships. The infraspinatus muscle, which _________ from the infraspinous fossa to the greater tuberosity of the humerus, serves a crucial function in shoulder mobility. When conducting ultrasound examination of this region, practitioners must carefully evaluate the suprascapular nerve pathway, particularly at the suprascapular and spinoglenoid notches. The addition of Doppler imaging can enhance visualization of the suprascapular artery, which provides a reliable anatomical landmark for identifying adjacent neural structures.

## Question
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

## Skill
Words in Context

## Choices
- A) extends
- B) traverses
- C) progresses
- D) courses

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: While "extends" suggests movement from one point to another, it lacks the specific anatomical precision needed in this context
- B) Incorrect: "Traverses" implies crossing or passing through, which doesn't accurately describe the muscle's fixed anatomical path
- C) Incorrect: "Progresses" suggests a gradual advancement, which is inappropriate for describing a static anatomical structure
- D) Correct: "Courses" is the most precise anatomical term for describing the path or route that a muscle takes from its origin to insertion point, maintaining the technical accuracy required in medical contexts
