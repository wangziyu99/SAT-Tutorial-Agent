## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya et al. (2024), discussing the implementation of lung ultrasound in diagnostic procedures.

## Passage
Recent advances in medical imaging have revolutionized diagnostic procedures, particularly in respiratory conditions. While traditional methods remain valuable, emerging research suggests that ________. This shift in diagnostic approach has been particularly evident in post-viral conditions, where subtle tissue changes require precise detection methods. A comprehensive study of 352 patients demonstrated that ultrasound imaging could detect abnormalities that conventional X-rays often missed, leading to more targeted treatment protocols. The implications of these findings extend beyond immediate diagnosis, suggesting a paradigm shift in how we approach long-term patient monitoring and care management.

## Question
Which choice most logically completes the text?

## Skill
Inferences

## Choices
A) lung ultrasound may eventually replace conventional imaging as the primary diagnostic tool for respiratory conditions
B) medical professionals should combine multiple imaging techniques for optimal diagnosis
C) patients prefer ultrasound imaging due to its non-invasive nature
D) technological advancements have made ultrasound equipment more accessible

## Answer
A) Correct: This choice logically follows from the passage's emphasis on ultrasound's superior detection capabilities and the broader implications for diagnostic procedures.
B) Incorrect: While this might be true, it contradicts the passage's focus on ultrasound's singular importance.
C) Incorrect: Patient preference is not discussed in the passage.
D) Incorrect: Equipment accessibility is not mentioned or implied in the passage.
