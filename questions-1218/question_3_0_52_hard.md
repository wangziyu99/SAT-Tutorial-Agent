## Abstract
The following texts are adapted from "Medical Imaging Safety Protocols" by Dr. Sarah Chen (2023) and "Advances in Diagnostic Ultrasound" from the Journal of Medical Physics (2024).

## Passage
Text 1:
Recent studies have demonstrated that ultrasound-induced cavitation can produce significant bioeffects in tissue. While these effects are generally benign at diagnostic power levels, they become increasingly concerning at higher mechanical index (MI) values. The phenomenon occurs when ultrasound waves create microscopic bubbles in tissue fluid, which can collapse violently, potentially damaging surrounding cells. This mechanism has been observed particularly in tissues with high gas content, such as lung tissue.

Text 2:
The International Commission on Medical Ultrasound Safety has established strict guidelines for diagnostic ultrasound procedures. These protocols mandate continuous monitoring of mechanical index values and recommend maintaining MI below 0.3 for routine scanning. The guidelines emphasize the importance of operator training and proper equipment calibration to minimize potential biological effects.

## Question
How would the author of Text 1 most likely respond to the safety protocols described in Text 2?

## Skill
Cross-Text Connections

## Choices
- A) Endorsement, as the protocols directly address the tissue damage concerns raised in Text 1
- B) Skepticism, as the recommended MI threshold seems unnecessarily conservative
- C) Indifference, as the protocols don't relate to the biological mechanisms described
- D) Opposition, as the guidelines overlook important aspects of cavitation effects

## Answer
- A) Correct: The author of Text 1 would likely endorse Text 2's protocols because they specifically address the cavitation concerns and tissue damage risks outlined in Text 1
- B) Incorrect: The MI threshold aligns with Text 1's emphasis on damage potential at higher values
- C) Incorrect: The protocols directly relate to the biological mechanisms discussed in Text 1
- D) Incorrect: Rather than overlooking cavitation effects, the guidelines specifically target them
