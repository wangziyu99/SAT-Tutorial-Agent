## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya et al. (2024), discussing the limitations of 3D/4D ultrasound technology in medical diagnostics.

## Passage
Current 3D/4D ultrasound technology has demonstrated significant limitations in certain diagnostic scenarios. Image quality can be substantially compromised when attempting to visualize fetal structures in challenging positions. _____ these technical constraints have prompted researchers to question the reliability of blood flow measurements during IVF procedures, as single-point temporal data has proven insufficient for accurate pregnancy prediction. The American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine recently convened a panel of experts to evaluate both the current capabilities and limitations of this technology, particularly focusing on its applications in obstetrics and gynecology. Their findings suggest that while 3D/4D imaging represents a significant advancement, its clinical utility remains constrained by specific technical parameters.

## Question
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

## Skill
Transitions

## Choices
- A) Nevertheless,
- B) Similarly,
- C) Moreover,
- D) Instead,

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: "Nevertheless" implies contrast, which doesn't fit the logical flow between the sentences.
- B) Incorrect: "Similarly" suggests parallel ideas, but the second sentence presents an additional, distinct limitation.
- C) Correct: "Moreover" appropriately connects two related but distinct limitations of the technology, maintaining the logical flow while adding new information.
- D) Incorrect: "Instead" implies replacement or alternative, which doesn't match the additive relationship between the sentences.
