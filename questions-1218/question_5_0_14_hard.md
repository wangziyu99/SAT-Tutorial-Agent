## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya, Sithole, Welsh, and Dana (2024).

## Passage
When ultrasound waves encounter biological tissues, they create complex patterns of reflection and absorption that _________. The computer system interprets these patterns by analyzing both the amplitude of returning echoes and the time delay between transmission and reception. In dense structures, such as bone, the waves are completely reflected, generating what technicians term a "posterior acoustic shadow" - a bright, highly echogenic region followed by a distinctive echo void. This phenomenon occurs because the dense material prevents wave transmission beyond the initial point of contact. However, the accuracy of these interpretations relies on two fundamental assumptions: that ultrasound beams maintain both linear propagation and consistent attenuation rates, and that waves follow direct paths to and from reflecting tissues. When these assumptions are violated, the resulting image artifacts can significantly complicate the differentiation between actual anatomical structures and false representations.

## Question
Which choice most effectively explains how ultrasound waves interact with biological tissues while maintaining the technical precision of the passage?

## Skill
Command of Evidence (Textual, Quantitative)

## Choices
- A) produce diagnostic images based on tissue density variations
- B) generate electrical signals that computers can process
- C) form distinctive patterns of acoustic impedance and reflection
- D) create measurable differences in wave velocity and frequency

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: Too general and oversimplifies the complex interaction described in the passage
- B) Incorrect: Focuses on the end result rather than the physical interaction
- C) Correct: Maintains the technical precision while accurately describing the physical interaction between ultrasound waves and tissues
- D) Incorrect: While related to ultrasound physics, this choice doesn't specifically address the interaction described in the passage
