## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Arbin Thapaliya et al. (2024), discussing the phenomenon of reverberation artifacts in medical ultrasound imaging.

## Passage
In ultrasound imaging, reverberation artifacts present a significant challenge to accurate diagnosis. These artifacts manifest as multiple horizontal lines that maintain equal spacing and typically become more pronounced as tissue depth increases. When ultrasonic waves encounter highly reflective interfaces, they can bounce multiple times between the transducer and the reflecting surface, creating _________. The primary reflection represents the true anatomical structure, while subsequent echoes produce false images at regular intervals deeper in the tissue. This phenomenon is particularly problematic when the transducer itself acts as a secondary reflecting surface, causing returning echoes to be re-reflected back into the tissue-reflecting structure. Such secondary reflections generate identical artifacts at twice the distance from the transducer, though their intensity progressively diminishes due to acoustic attenuation.

## Question
Which choice best explains the mechanism that creates reverberation artifacts while maintaining consistency with the technical details presented in the passage?

## Skill
Command of Evidence (Textual)

## Choices
A) a series of progressively fainter duplicate images at regular depth intervals
B) distorted images that appear closer to the transducer than their actual location
C) scattered reflections that merge into a single, intensified image
D) random echo patterns that vary in both intensity and spacing

## Answer
A) Correct: This choice accurately describes the phenomenon detailed in the passage, explaining both the regular spacing and diminishing intensity of the artifacts.
B) Incorrect: Contradicts the passage's description of artifacts appearing deeper, not closer to the transducer.
C) Incorrect: The passage describes multiple distinct images rather than merged reflections.
D) Incorrect: The passage emphasizes regular, not random, spacing of the artifacts.
