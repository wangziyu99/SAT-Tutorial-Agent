## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Arbin Thapaliya, Alec Sithole, Michael Welsh, and Gaston Dana (2024).

## Passage
The foramen ovale (FO) typically closes within the first year after birth. In some cases, however, this opening persists, resulting in what medical professionals term a patent foramen ovale (PFO). While PFOs are generally asymptomatic, they require careful monitoring. _____ research has shown that infants with congenital heart abnormalities face a significantly higher risk of PFO persistence. This correlation stems from complex developmental patterns in cardiac formation, particularly in the growth of septal walls. The process involves the gradual extension of tissue from the cavity walls toward the center, creating distinct chambers. When this development deviates from its normal course, various septal defects may emerge, necessitating advanced diagnostic techniques such as color flow Doppler ultrasound for accurate assessment.

## Question
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

## Skill
Transitions

## Choices
- A) Nevertheless,
- B) Similarly,
- C) Moreover,
- D) Instead,

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: "Nevertheless" suggests contrast, which doesn't fit the logical flow between these statements
- B) Incorrect: "Similarly" implies parallel ideas, but the text introduces new, related information rather than similar content
- C) Correct: "Moreover" appropriately signals the addition of related, supporting information about PFOs and their relationship to congenital heart abnormalities
- D) Incorrect: "Instead" suggests replacement or contradiction, which doesn't match the passage's logical progression
