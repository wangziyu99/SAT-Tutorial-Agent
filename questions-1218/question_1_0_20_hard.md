## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya, Sithole, Welsh, and Dana (2024).

## Passage
In medical imaging, the precision of ultrasound diagnostics largely depends on how effectively the device _____ aberrant signal patterns. While the primary ultrasound beam follows a direct path, secondary waves frequently deviate from the main axis, creating what specialists term "grating lobe artifacts." These artifacts emerge when strong reflectors intercept these divergent waves, generating false echoes that the imaging system misinterprets as originating from the primary beam path. The resulting distortion can significantly compromise diagnostic accuracy, particularly in cases where subtle anatomical distinctions are crucial for clinical assessment.

## Question
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

## Skill
Words in Context

## Choices
- A) mitigates
- B) circumvents
- C) discriminates
- D) neutralizes

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: While "mitigates" suggests reducing severity, it doesn't capture the specific action of distinguishing between signals
- B) Incorrect: "Circumvents" implies avoiding rather than actively addressing the issue
- C) Correct: "Discriminates" precisely describes the device's need to distinguish between valid and invalid signal patterns, making it the most appropriate choice in this technical context
- D) Incorrect: "Neutralizes" suggests elimination rather than the necessary function of differentiation
