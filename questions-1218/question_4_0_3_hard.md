## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya, Sithole, Welsh, and Dana (2024).

## Passage
The relationship between sound propagation and tissue examination represents one of medicine's most sophisticated diagnostic tools. In clinical settings, ultrasound waves operating between 2 and 20 MHz frequencies navigate through complex biological structures, their behavior governed by the inverse square law of intensity. This fundamental principle dictates that sound intensity diminishes proportionally to the square of the distance from its source, a phenomenon quantified through the decibel scale. The decibel, a dimensionless unit denoted as dB, operates on a logarithmic basis relative to the threshold of human hearing (Io = 10^-12 W/m^2). This precise mathematical relationship enables clinicians to ___________, ultimately transforming abstract wave physics into meaningful diagnostic information.

## Question

## Skill
Central Ideas and Details

## Choices
- A) calibrate imaging equipment for optimal tissue visualization
- B) measure sound waves in laboratory environments
- C) interpret acoustic patterns in various medical contexts
- D) calculate exact tissue depths using wave frequencies

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: Too narrow and technical, focusing only on equipment
- B) Incorrect: Too general and doesn't connect to the medical context
- C) Correct: This choice maintains the passage's focus on the clinical application of sound physics while connecting the mathematical principles to practical medical use
- D) Incorrect: Overly specific to one application and doesn't fully capture the broader implications discussed
