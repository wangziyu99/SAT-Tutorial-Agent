## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024).

## Passage
The production of hybrid seeds through plant breeding varies significantly depending on the parent plants involved. When working with clonal parents, which are genetically identical copies, the process differs from breeding with pure-line or inbred parents. The hybrid offspring from a single cross of clonal parents form what scientists call a segregating population, which breeders use to select superior new clones. The number of hybrid seeds needed from a cross directly relates to how many individual plants the breeder wishes to evaluate. For instance, if a breeder plans to study 1,000 individual plants, they would need to produce at least _____ hybrid seeds from the cross. Since clonal parents are genetically uniform, the number of parent plants used in crossing is not a critical factor.

## Question
Which choice provides the most logical number to complete the statement about the required number of hybrid seeds?

## Skill
Command of Evidence (Quantitative)

## Choices
- A) 1,000
- B) 500
- C) 2,000
- D) 100

## Answer
- A) Correct: The passage directly states that the number of hybrid seeds needed equals the number of individuals to be evaluated. Since the breeder wants to evaluate 1,000 plants, they would need 1,000 seeds.
- B) Incorrect: This number is too low to evaluate 1,000 plants, as each plant requires one seed.
- C) Incorrect: This number exceeds what's necessary according to the passage's one-to-one relationship between seeds and plants.
- D) Incorrect: This number would only allow for evaluating 100 plants, far fewer than the desired 1,000.
