## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods: A Guide to Artificial Hybridization" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024).

## Passage
While researching plant breeding methods, a student has taken the following notes:
1. Artificial hybridization in plants requires careful timing and understanding of flower anatomy.
2. In some flowers, the female reproductive organ is surrounded by anthers that release pollen at specific times.
3. The maturity of anthers can be determined by their position - immature anthers are shorter and don't reach the stigma.
4. Natural pollination occurs when mature anthers grow longer and surround the stigma, allowing for pollen release.
5. Some flowers don't require manual removal of anthers (emasculation) because the stigma becomes unreceptive before the flower's own pollen matures.

## Question
The student wants to explain to beginning botanists why some flowers don't need manual anther removal during artificial hybridization. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?

## Skill
Rhetorical Synthesis

## Choices
- A) The stigma naturally becomes unreceptive to pollen by the time the flower's own anthers mature and release pollen
- B) Artificial hybridization requires careful timing and understanding of flower anatomy
- C) The female reproductive organ is surrounded by anthers that release pollen at specific times
- D) Natural pollination occurs when mature anthers grow longer and surround the stigma

## Answer
- A) Correct: This directly addresses why emasculation isn't needed by explaining the timing of stigma receptivity
- B) Incorrect: Too general and doesn't explain why emasculation isn't necessary
- C) Incorrect: States a fact about flower anatomy but doesn't explain why emasculation isn't needed
- D) Incorrect: Describes natural pollination but doesn't explain why manual anther removal isn't necessary
