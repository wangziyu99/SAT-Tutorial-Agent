## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya, Sithole, Welsh, and Dana (2024).

## Passage
Recent advances in medical imaging have _________ our understanding of ultrasound bioeffects, particularly regarding the complex interplay between thermal and mechanical impacts on tissue. While conventional wisdom suggested that tissue damage occurred primarily through thermal mechanisms, emerging research indicates that mechanical effects, including acoustic cavitation and streaming, play an equally significant role in cellular responses. This paradigm shift has prompted clinicians to reconsider traditional safety protocols, especially in applications requiring prolonged exposure or elevated intensity levels. The implications of these findings extend beyond diagnostic imaging to therapeutic applications, where precise control of bioeffects could potentially revolutionize targeted tissue treatment.

## Question
Which choice best completes the passage while maintaining its scholarly tone and supporting its central idea about the evolution of ultrasound research?

## Skill
Words in Context

## Choices
- A) transformed
- B) recalibrated
- C) nuanced
- D) augmented

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: While "transformed" suggests significant change, it lacks the precision and academic tone the context requires.
- B) Correct: "Recalibrated" precisely conveys the systematic adjustment of scientific understanding while maintaining the technical tone and supporting the passage's focus on evolving research perspectives.
- C) Incorrect: "Nuanced" suggests subtle refinement, which understates the significant shift in understanding described in the passage.
- D) Incorrect: "Augmented" implies simple addition rather than the fundamental reassessment described in the passage.
