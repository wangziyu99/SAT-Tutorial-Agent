## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Arbin Thapaliya, Alec Sithole, Michael Welsh, and Gaston Dana (2024).

## Passage
Modern ultrasound technology has revolutionized medical imaging capabilities_ offering unprecedented views of internal structures. The advancement from 2D to 3D/4D imaging has particularly enhanced diagnostic precision in cardiology and prenatal care. While 2D imaging provides static cross-sectional views, 3D technology generates volumetric data that can be manipulated to reveal complex anatomical relationships. The latest 4D systems capture these three-dimensional images in real time, enabling clinicians to observe dynamic processes such as cardiac valve function or fetal movement. Despite these advantages, each modality has specific clinical applications where it proves most effective.

## Question
Which choice best joins the independent clauses to create a grammatically sound and stylistically effective sentence?

## Skill
Boundaries

## Choices
- A) technology has revolutionized medical imaging capabilities, offering
- B) technology has revolutionized medical imaging capabilities; offering
- C) technology has revolutionized medical imaging capabilities offering
- D) technology has revolutionized medical imaging capabilities: offering

## Answer
- A) Correct: This choice correctly uses a comma to join the main clause with the participial phrase that follows, maintaining proper grammatical flow.
- B) Incorrect: A semicolon is inappropriate here as it should join two independent clauses, but "offering unprecedented views" is a participial phrase, not an independent clause.
- C) Incorrect: This creates a run-on sentence by failing to provide proper punctuation between the main clause and the participial phrase.
- D) Incorrect: A colon is inappropriate here as it should introduce a list, explanation, or quotation, not a participial phrase.
