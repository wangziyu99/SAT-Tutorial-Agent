## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024), discussing the advantages of DNA markers in plant breeding.

## Passage
DNA markers have become increasingly valuable tools in modern plant breeding. In some cases, these molecular markers can be more reliable than traditional phenotypic evaluation, which relies on observing physical traits. For example, when studying disease resistance in plants, researchers might find that some plants escape infection by chance, leading to false results. DNA markers eliminate this uncertainty by directly identifying genetic traits. They are particularly useful in plants with long life cycles, such as trees, or when important traits appear only in mature plants. In asparagus plants, determining the sex of individual plants is important for breeding, but this trait isn't visible until the plant is at least two years old. Similarly, ginkgo trees must reach full maturity before their sex can be determined through traditional observation methods.

## Question
Which quotation from the passage best supports the claim that DNA markers can be more efficient than traditional plant breeding methods?

## Skill
Command of Evidence (Textual, Quantitative)

## Choices
A) "DNA markers have become increasingly valuable tools in modern plant breeding"
B) "researchers might find that some plants escape infection by chance, leading to false results"
C) "determining the sex of individual plants is important for breeding"
D) "ginkgo trees must reach full maturity before their sex can be determined"

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: This is a general statement that doesn't specifically demonstrate efficiency
- B) Correct: This quote directly illustrates why DNA markers are more efficient by showing how traditional methods can lead to unreliable results
- C) Incorrect: This states importance but doesn't compare efficiency
- D) Incorrect: This describes a limitation of traditional methods but doesn't directly compare efficiency
