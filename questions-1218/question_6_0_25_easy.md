## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024), discussing modern DNA analysis techniques in plant breeding.

## Passage
DNA analysis has revolutionized how plant breeders identify desirable traits in crops. When scientists want to determine if a plant carries a specific genetic trait, they must first obtain DNA from the plant tissue. The most reliable source of DNA comes from ___________, as this material provides the clearest genetic information. Once collected, the DNA undergoes a process called PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), which makes thousands of copies of specific DNA regions. This amplification technique, developed in the 1980s, allows scientists to work with even tiny amounts of genetic material to identify important plant characteristics.

## Question
Which choice most logically completes the text?

## Skill
Inferences

## Choices
- A) young leaf samples
- B) mature fruit tissue
- C) dried plant stems
- D) dormant seeds

## Answer
- A) Correct: The passage discusses the need for reliable DNA sources, and young leaf tissue is typically the best source as it contains actively dividing cells with fresh genetic material.
- B) Incorrect: Mature fruit tissue often contains degraded DNA and other compounds that can interfere with analysis.
- C) Incorrect: Dried plant stems typically contain poor quality DNA due to tissue degradation.
- D) Incorrect: While seeds can be used for DNA extraction, they aren't typically the most reliable source for clear genetic information.
