## Abstract
The following texts are adapted from "Wave Physics in Medical Applications" by Dr. Sarah Chen (2023) and "Modern Medical Imaging Technologies" by Dr. James Roberts (2024).

## Passage
Text 1:
Wave propagation in biological tissues exhibits complex behavior due to the medium's inherent properties. When ultrasound waves encounter tissue interfaces, they undergo both reflection and refraction, following _____. This phenomenon allows medical professionals to create detailed images of internal structures, though the interpretation requires sophisticated understanding of wave-tissue interactions.

Text 2:
Modern ultrasound imaging relies heavily on computerized analysis of wave patterns. While traditional approaches focused on simple reflection patterns, contemporary systems utilize advanced algorithms to account for wave scattering and absorption. This technological evolution has dramatically improved image resolution, though some argue that over-reliance on automated interpretation may lead to missed subtle tissue anomalies.

## Question
Based on both passages, what principle would most logically complete the blank in Text 1?

## Skill
Cross-Text Connections

## Choices
- A) basic acoustic principles that vary with tissue density
- B) standardized medical imaging protocols
- C) computer-generated wave patterns
- D) simplified reflection models

## Answer
- A) Correct: This answer bridges both texts by acknowledging the physical principles (Text 1) while supporting the need for sophisticated analysis (Text 2)
- B) Incorrect: Too focused on procedure rather than the physical principles discussed
- C) Incorrect: Reverses the relationship; computers analyze patterns, not create them
- D) Incorrect: Contradicts Text 2's emphasis on moving beyond simple models
