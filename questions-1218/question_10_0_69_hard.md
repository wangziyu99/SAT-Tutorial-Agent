## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya et al. (2024), discussing advanced medical imaging techniques.

## Passage
The evaluation of rotator cuff tears through ultrasound imaging requires precise methodology and understanding of anatomical structures. When examining partial-thickness tears, clinicians must distinguish between articular surface involvement and bursal surface manifestation. _____ these distinctions are critical for accurate diagnosis, the measurement of tear diameter along both long and short axes provides essential quantitative data. The process becomes more complex when imaging the posterior cuff, which requires repositioning the transducer below the scapular spine in an oblique axial plane. This deeper anatomical position often necessitates the use of a curvilinear probe for enhanced penetration, particularly when examining the infraspinatus and teres minor tendons from their origins to insertions.

## Question
Which choice best completes the text with the most logical transition?

## Skill
Transitions

## Choices
- A) Nevertheless,
- B) Similarly,
- C) Although
- D) Just as

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: "Nevertheless" implies contrast, but the relationship between the distinctions and measurements is additive, not contrasting.
- B) Incorrect: "Similarly" suggests parallel ideas, but the text moves from qualitative assessment to quantitative measurement.
- C) Correct: "Although" appropriately sets up the relationship between the importance of distinguishing tear types and the additional need for quantitative measurements, suggesting a complementary rather than contradictory relationship.
- D) Incorrect: "Just as" implies a direct comparison, but the text presents related but distinct aspects of the examination process.
