## Abstract
The following texts are adapted from "Advances in Cardiac Imaging" (2024) by Dr. Sarah Chen and "Modern Medical Technologies" (2024) by Dr. James Roberts.

## Passage
Text 1:
Recent advances in cardiac imaging technology have revolutionized our approach to diagnosing congenital heart defects. Traditional methods relied heavily on physical examination and basic imaging, often missing subtle abnormalities. However, the integration of artificial intelligence with high-resolution imaging has enabled the detection of complex cardiac malformations at unprecedented accuracy rates. This technological leap has particularly benefited prenatal diagnostics, though some experts caution against over-reliance on automated systems.

Text 2:
While artificial intelligence has undoubtedly enhanced medical imaging capabilities, the fundamental role of experienced clinicians cannot be understated. The interpretation of cardiac images requires a nuanced understanding of both normal anatomical variations and pathological changes. Machine learning algorithms, despite their sophistication, currently serve best as supportive tools rather than primary diagnostic instruments.

## Question
How would the author of Text 1 most likely respond to the perspective presented in Text 2?

## Skill
Cross-Text Connections

## Choices
- A) Agreement, while emphasizing the transformative potential of AI-enhanced imaging
- B) Strong disagreement, arguing that AI should replace human interpretation
- C) Indifference, as Text 1 focuses solely on technological advancement
- D) Confusion, since the texts present contradictory views on medical imaging

## Answer
- A) Correct: Text 1 acknowledges AI's revolutionary impact while noting expert cautions, aligning with Text 2's balanced perspective
- B) Incorrect: Text 1 doesn't suggest AI should replace humans; it mentions expert cautions
- C) Incorrect: Text 1 shows awareness of both technological and clinical aspects
- D) Incorrect: The texts present complementary rather than contradictory views
