## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Arbin Thapaliya et al. (2024).

## Passage
While three-dimensional ultrasound imaging has revolutionized several medical fields, its adoption across healthcare remains _________. This technology, which constructs detailed volumetric images from multiple two-dimensional planes, has found particular success in specialized areas like gynecology and obstetrics. The selective implementation reflects both the technology's sophisticated capabilities and its inherent limitations. In gynecology, practitioners leverage 3D ultrasound for precise examination of reproductive structures and interventional procedures, yet many routine medical assessments continue to rely on traditional imaging methods. This pattern of adoption suggests that the technology's value proposition varies significantly across different medical contexts, with its utility being most pronounced in scenarios requiring detailed structural analysis.

## Question
Which choice most logically completes the text?

## Skill
Inferences

## Choices
- A) uneven but strategically focused
- B) rapidly accelerating
- C) technically challenging
- D) fundamentally misunderstood

## Answer
- A) Correct: This answer best captures the passage's description of selective adoption in specific fields while acknowledging limited use in routine procedures
- B) Incorrect: Contradicts the passage's indication of limited adoption in routine procedures
- C) Incorrect: While technical complexity might be implied, the passage focuses on adoption patterns rather than technical difficulties
- D) Incorrect: The passage suggests deliberate selection rather than misunderstanding of the technology
