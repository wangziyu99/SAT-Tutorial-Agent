## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024).

## Passage
In the field of plant breeding, polycross techniques are essential for developing new varieties. The process begins when researchers prepare isolated plantings_ the breeder carefully marks the field and transplants selected clones vegetatively. During the flowering period, wind carries pollen between plants, creating a diverse mixture of genetic material. This method proves particularly effective with tall fescue, where rye borders often serve as isolation barriers. The technique allows breeders to maintain control over cross-pollination while promoting genetic diversity.

## Choices
- A) In the field of plant breeding, polycross techniques are essential for developing new varieties. The process begins when researchers prepare isolated plantings, the breeder carefully marks the field
- B) In the field of plant breeding, polycross techniques are essential for developing new varieties. The process begins when researchers prepare isolated plantings: the breeder carefully marks the field
- C) In the field of plant breeding, polycross techniques are essential for developing new varieties. The process begins when researchers prepare isolated plantings; the breeder carefully marks the field
- D) In the field of plant breeding, polycross techniques are essential for developing new varieties. The process begins when researchers prepare isolated plantings. The breeder carefully marks the field

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: A comma creates a comma splice between two independent clauses
- B) Incorrect: A colon is inappropriate as the second clause isn't explaining or elaborating on the first
- C) Correct: A semicolon correctly joins two related independent clauses
- D) Incorrect: A period creates unnecessarily choppy sentences where the ideas are closely related
