## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya et al. (2024), discussing the anatomical relationships and ultrasound characteristics of renal structures.

## Passage
While the precise cellular architecture of nephrons _____ beyond the resolution capabilities of conventional ultrasound imaging, the technology nonetheless provides valuable insights into renal pathology. The kidney's distinctive appearance on ultrasound, bounded by the hyperechoic Gerota's fascia, enables clinicians to assess critical anatomical parameters. This fibrous envelope not only delineates the organ's boundaries but also serves as a crucial landmark for evaluating adjacent structures. The characteristic dimensions of an adult kidney—ranging from 11 to 14 centimeters in length—combined with its predictable spatial relationships to the liver superiorly on the right and the spleen on the left, creates a reliable framework for diagnostic interpretation.

## Question
Which choice best completes the text so that it maintains both grammatical accuracy and logical coherence with the rest of the passage?

## Skill
Form, Structure, and Sense

## Choices
- A) lies
- B) lay
- C) are lying
- D) have laid

## Answer
- A) Correct: "Lies" is the correct present tense singular verb that agrees with the singular subject "architecture" and maintains the academic tone of the passage.
- B) Incorrect: "Lay" is the past tense form and doesn't match the present tense context of the passage.
- C) Incorrect: "Are lying" is plural and doesn't agree with the singular subject "architecture."
- D) Incorrect: "Have laid" is perfect tense and transitive, requiring a direct object, which isn't appropriate in this context.
