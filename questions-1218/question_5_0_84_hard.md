## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya et al. (2024), discussing the role of ultrasound imaging in COVID-19 diagnosis.

## Passage
In COVID-19 patients, pulmonary manifestations often present unique challenges in diagnostic imaging. While traditional chest X-rays provide limited information, ultrasound imaging has emerged as a valuable diagnostic tool. The progression of the disease typically manifests in the posterior and inferior portions of the lung, where focal infiltrates create distinctive patterns. These areas appear as _____ on ultrasound imaging, contrasting sharply with the normal anechoic regions of healthy lung tissue. This characteristic appearance, resulting from inflammation of the bronchioles and alveoli, has become a crucial marker for disease progression. Recent studies suggest that the distribution pattern of these infiltrates, when identified through ultrasound imaging, may serve as a preliminary diagnostic indicator, warranting further COVID-19-specific testing.

## Question
Which quotation from the passage best supports the claim that ultrasound imaging provides distinctive visual markers for COVID-19 diagnosis?

## Skill
Command of Evidence (Textual, Quantitative)

## Choices
- A) "While traditional chest X-rays provide limited information, ultrasound imaging has emerged as a valuable diagnostic tool"
- B) "These areas appear as _____ on ultrasound imaging, contrasting sharply with the normal anechoic regions of healthy lung tissue"
- C) "Recent studies suggest that the distribution pattern of these infiltrates... may serve as a preliminary diagnostic indicator"
- D) "The progression of the disease typically manifests in the posterior and inferior portions of the lung"

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: This quote establishes ultrasound's general utility but doesn't specify visual markers
- B) Correct: This quote directly addresses the distinctive visual contrast between diseased and healthy tissue in ultrasound imaging
- C) Incorrect: This quote discusses the diagnostic implications but not the specific visual markers
- D) Incorrect: This quote describes location but not the distinctive visual markers
