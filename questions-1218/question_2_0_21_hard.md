## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya, Sithole, Welsh, and Dana (2024).

## Passage
The complexity of ultrasound imaging lies not merely in capturing echoes but in interpreting their veracity. When the primary ultrasound beam encounters anatomical structures, it can generate multipath artifactsâ€”a phenomenon where _____. This occurs as the initial beam reflects off tissue at an angle, creating two distinct echo paths: one returning directly to the transducer, and another bouncing off a secondary boundary before detection. The temporal disparity between these echoes leads to spatial misrepresentation, as the imaging system calculates depth based on echo return time. Consequently, the delayed secondary echo is interpreted as originating from a deeper anatomical position, resulting in a duplicated or misplaced image. This technical limitation necessitates multiple viewing angles during examination, as authentic structures maintain consistent positioning across different perspectives.

## Question
Which choice most effectively explains the phenomenon introduced by the underlined portion?

## Skill
Text Structure and Purpose

## Choices
- A) echo patterns create misleading duplicate images due to multiple reflection pathways
- B) sound waves disperse randomly throughout anatomical structures
- C) ultrasound beams lose intensity as they penetrate deeper tissues
- D) imaging artifacts result from equipment calibration errors

## Answer
- A) Correct: This choice precisely captures the technical explanation of multipath artifacts described in the passage, where multiple reflection pathways create misleading images.
- B) Incorrect: The passage describes specific reflection patterns, not random dispersion.
- C) Incorrect: While this may be true of ultrasound in general, it's not the phenomenon being described in the passage.
- D) Incorrect: The artifacts described are due to natural physical properties of sound reflection, not equipment errors.
