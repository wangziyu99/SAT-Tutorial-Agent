## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024).

## Passage
While researching plant breeding methods, a student has taken the following notes:
1. Traditional plant breeding involves selecting plants with desirable traits and cross-breeding them to create improved varieties.
2. Modern plant breeders use genetic markers to identify specific traits in plants before breeding begins.
3. Genetic markers have made plant breeding more efficient by reducing the time needed to develop new varieties.
4. Plant breeders can now screen thousands of plants in early growth stages, rather than waiting for plants to mature to observe traits.

## Question
The student wants to explain to farmers how modern plant breeding differs from traditional methods. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?

## Skill
Rhetorical Synthesis

## Choices
- A) Traditional plant breeding relies on selecting plants with desirable traits through observation
- B) Modern plant breeding uses genetic markers to identify desired traits early, making the breeding process faster and more efficient than traditional methods
- C) Plant breeders can now examine thousands of plants at once using new technology
- D) Genetic markers have changed how plant breeding is conducted in modern times

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: Only mentions traditional methods without showing the contrast with modern techniques
- B) Correct: Effectively synthesizes information from notes 2 and 3 to explain the key difference and benefit of modern methods
- C) Incorrect: Focuses on only one aspect without explaining the significance of the difference
- D) Incorrect: Too vague and doesn't explain how or why the change is significant
