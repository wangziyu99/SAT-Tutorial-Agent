## Abstract
The following texts are adapted from "Medical Ultrasound: Physics and Applications" by A. Thapaliya et al. (2024) and "Principles of Diagnostic Sonography" by M. Welsh (2024).

## Passage
Text 1:
Diagnostic ultrasound relies on the principle of acoustic impedance, where sound waves reflect differently off various tissue interfaces. The reflection coefficient (R) at a tissue boundary is determined by the difference in acoustic impedance between adjacent tissues. When this difference is significant, more ultrasound energy is reflected, producing stronger echo signals. However, this same property can paradoxically limit imaging depth, as strong reflections reduce the energy available for deeper tissue penetration.

Text 2:
Modern ultrasound imaging protocols emphasize optimizing the balance between frequency and penetration depth. Higher frequencies provide better resolution but reduced penetration, while lower frequencies allow deeper imaging at the cost of resolution. Practitioners must carefully select appropriate frequency ranges based on the specific diagnostic requirements and anatomical region being examined.

## Question
How would the author of Text 1 most likely respond to the approach described in Text 2?

## Skill
Cross-Text Connections

## Choices
- A) Support, because it addresses the fundamental trade-off inherent in acoustic impedance principles
- B) Skepticism, because it oversimplifies the complex nature of ultrasound physics
- C) Neutrality, because it discusses a different aspect of ultrasound imaging
- D) Opposition, because it contradicts the basic principles of reflection coefficients

## Answer
- A) Correct: The author of Text 1 would likely support Text 2's approach as it directly addresses the practical implications of the physical principles described in Text 1, particularly how strong reflections affect imaging depth.
- B) Incorrect: Text 2's approach aligns with rather than oversimplifies the principles in Text 1.
- C) Incorrect: The texts are closely related, discussing complementary aspects of ultrasound imaging.
- D) Incorrect: Text 2's protocols are based on, rather than contradict, the principles described in Text 1.
