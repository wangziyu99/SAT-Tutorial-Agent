## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya et al. (2024).

## Passage
When an ultrasound wave encounters the boundary between two biological tissues, its behavior is governed by the principle of acoustic impedance. At these interfaces, the wave undergoes a complex interaction where _________. This phenomenon explains why certain tissue boundaries appear more prominently in ultrasound imaging than others. The degree of reflection depends on the difference in acoustic impedance between the adjacent tissues, with greater disparities producing stronger reflections. Understanding this principle is crucial for medical professionals interpreting ultrasound images, as it helps them distinguish between normal anatomical structures and potential pathologies.

## Question
Which choice most logically completes the text?

## Skill
Inferences

## Choices
- A) the wave's energy is partially reflected while the remainder continues through the second medium
- B) the wave's frequency increases to compensate for the change in tissue density
- C) the wave completely bounces back to maintain energy conservation
- D) the wave's amplitude doubles to overcome the tissue barrier

## Answer
- A) Correct: This accurately describes the physical behavior of ultrasound waves at tissue boundaries, consistent with the passage's discussion of acoustic impedance and reflection.
- B) Incorrect: Frequency remains constant during reflection and transmission; this contradicts basic physics principles.
- C) Incorrect: Complete reflection would contradict the passage's implication that waves can penetrate different tissue layers.
- D) Incorrect: Amplitude increase at boundaries isn't physically accurate and contradicts conservation of energy principles.
