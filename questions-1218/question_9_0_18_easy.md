## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024), discussing research notes on radiation treatment in plant breeding.

## Passage
While conducting research on plant breeding methods, a student has taken the following notes:

1. Plant cuttings must be of uniform size to ensure consistent radiation penetration during treatment.

2. Experiments tested radiation doses ranging from 0 to 200 Gy on both plant cuttings and callus tissue.

3. Survival rates were highest for plant cuttings treated with 50-70 Gy of radiation.

4. Callus tissue showed better recovery rates at lower radiation doses (25 and 50 Gy).

5. All treated specimens were maintained in moist conditions to prevent dehydration during the experiment.

## Question
The student wants to explain the optimal conditions for successful radiation treatment in plant breeding. Which choice most effectively uses the relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?

## Skill
Rhetorical Synthesis

## Choices
- A) Plant cuttings and callus tissue require different radiation doses for optimal survival
- B) Maintaining moist conditions is essential when treating plants with radiation
- C) Uniform size of plant cuttings ensures consistent radiation treatment results
- D) Plants can survive radiation doses up to 200 Gy during treatment

## Answer
- A) Correct: This answer effectively synthesizes information from multiple notes, showing how different plant materials respond to different radiation doses while remaining accessible to readers
- B) Incorrect: While true, this detail is secondary to the main findings about radiation dosage
- C) Incorrect: This only captures one aspect of the treatment process and doesn't address the key findings about survival rates
- D) Incorrect: This is misleading as the notes indicate optimal survival at much lower doses
