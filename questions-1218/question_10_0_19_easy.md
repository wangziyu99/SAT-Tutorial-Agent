## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024).

## Passage
Chemical mutagenesis has proven effective in developing crop varieties with desirable traits. In a recent study, researchers sought to create herbicide-tolerant barley plants. The process began with selecting the barley cultivar Bob for treatment with sodium azide. _____ the seeds required careful preparation, they were first pre-soaked at 0°C for 16 hours and then at 20°C for 8 hours. Following this preparation, the seeds were treated with sodium azide for 2 hours. The treated seeds were then planted in isolation, and the resulting plants were harvested to collect the next generation of seeds.

## Question
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

## Skill
Transitions

## Choices
- A) However,
- B) Because
- C) Therefore,
- D) Similarly,

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: "However" suggests contrast, but the preparation is a necessary step, not a contrasting idea.
- B) Correct: "Because" establishes a logical cause-and-effect relationship between the need for preparation and the pre-soaking process.
- C) Incorrect: "Therefore" suggests a conclusion, but the preparation is not a result of the previous statement.
- D) Incorrect: "Similarly" suggests comparison, but the preparation is a new step, not a similar one.
