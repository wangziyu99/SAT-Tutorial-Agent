## Abstract
The following texts are adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024) and "Agricultural Innovation Review" by Maria Chen (2024).

## Passage
Text 1:
Traditional plant breeding relies heavily on natural genetic variation within crop species. However, when desired traits are absent in existing varieties, breeders must look for alternative approaches. Natural mutations occur spontaneously but are rare, making it difficult for breeders to find specific desired characteristics. This limitation has led many agricultural scientists to explore more direct methods of creating genetic variation.

Text 2:
Modern agricultural innovation has embraced artificial mutation breeding as a valuable tool. By using controlled methods to induce genetic changes, scientists can develop new plant varieties with improved characteristics. This approach has successfully created crops with enhanced nutritional value, better disease resistance, and improved yield potential.

## Question
How would the author of Text 1 most likely respond to the methods described in Text 2?

## Skill
Cross-Text Connections

## Choices
- A) Support, because it addresses the limitations of traditional breeding methods
- B) Opposition, because natural mutations are sufficient for plant breeding
- C) Indifference, because the methods don't affect traditional breeding
- D) Skepticism, because artificial mutations are too unpredictable

## Answer
- A) Correct: Text 1 explicitly mentions the limitations of natural mutations and the need for alternative approaches, suggesting the author would support the artificial mutation methods described in Text 2
- B) Incorrect: Text 1 actually highlights the limitations of relying solely on natural mutations
- C) Incorrect: Text 1 shows clear interest in finding alternative breeding methods
- D) Incorrect: Text 1's discussion of limitations suggests openness to alternative methods, not skepticism
