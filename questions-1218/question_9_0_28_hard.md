## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Arbin Thapaliya, Alec Sithole, Michael Welsh, and Gaston Dana (2024).

## Passage
While researching ultrasound artifacts, a student has taken the following notes:

1. Reverberation artifacts occur when ultrasound waves bounce repeatedly between highly reflective interfaces, creating false echoes that appear as multiple parallel lines.

2. These artifacts are particularly problematic in medical imaging as they can obscure underlying structures and lead to misdiagnosis.

3. The phenomenon is especially common in areas containing air pockets or metallic objects, where the acoustic impedance difference between materials is significant.

4. Several techniques can minimize reverberation artifacts, including adjusting the transducer angle, modifying gain settings, and using specialized imaging protocols developed specifically for challenging anatomical regions.

## Question
The student wants to explain to medical residents why understanding reverberation artifacts is crucial for accurate diagnosis. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?

## Skill
Rhetorical Synthesis

## Choices
- A) Reverberation artifacts create multiple parallel lines in ultrasound images due to repeated wave bouncing between reflective interfaces
- B) The presence of air pockets and metallic objects commonly leads to reverberation artifacts in medical imaging
- C) These artifacts can compromise diagnostic accuracy by obscuring underlying structures, but can be minimized through various technical adjustments
- D) Medical professionals have developed specialized imaging protocols to address the challenges posed by reverberation artifacts

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: While technically accurate, this answer focuses only on the mechanical aspect without addressing the diagnostic importance
- B) Incorrect: This answer merely states where artifacts occur without explaining their clinical significance
- C) Correct: This answer synthesizes the clinical importance (diagnostic accuracy), the problem (obscured structures), and the solution (technical adjustments)
- D) Incorrect: This answer focuses too narrowly on one aspect of managing artifacts without explaining their significance
