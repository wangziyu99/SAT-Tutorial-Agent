## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya et al. (2024), a comprehensive review of medical imaging technology.

## Passage
Medical ultrasound imaging represents a sophisticated interplay between physics and diagnostic medicine. The technology _____ acoustic waves through biological tissues, creating detailed visualizations of internal structures. Unlike other imaging modalities, ultrasound relies on the distinctive properties of sound propagation through various tissue densities, generating real-time images through a complex process of wave reflection and signal processing. This non-invasive approach has revolutionized diagnostic capabilities, particularly in fields requiring dynamic visualization of physiological processes.

## Question
Which choice best completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

## Skill
Words in Context

## Choices
- A) manipulates
- B) leverages
- C) exploits
- D) harnesses

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: "Manipulates" suggests artificial alteration, which is too forceful for the neutral scientific context.
- B) Incorrect: "Leverages" has business connotations that don't fit the technical, scientific context.
- C) Incorrect: "Exploits" carries negative connotations and implies taking advantage, which is inappropriate for medical technology.
- D) Correct: "Harnesses" precisely conveys the idea of controlling and utilizing a natural phenomenon (acoustic waves) for beneficial purposes, maintaining both technical accuracy and appropriate tone.
