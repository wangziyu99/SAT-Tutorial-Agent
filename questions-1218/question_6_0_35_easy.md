## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024).

## Passage
When scientists use the Agrobacterium method to modify plants, they must carefully select which cells have successfully incorporated the new genes. The process begins when researchers infect plant tissue with bacteria carrying specific genetic material. These bacteria transfer the desired genes along with a marker that makes the modified cells resistant to antibiotics. When the tissue is placed in a medium containing antibiotics, ________. The surviving cells are then cultivated to produce complete plants, which are first grown in controlled environments like greenhouses before being moved to fields.

## Question
Which choice most logically completes the text?

## Skill
Inferences

## Choices
- A) only the successfully modified cells survive
- B) researchers can observe the bacteria's activity
- C) the plants develop resistance naturally
- D) the tissue becomes more vulnerable

## Answer
- A) Correct: This logically follows from the passage's explanation that modified cells receive antibiotic resistance, so they would be the only ones to survive in an antibiotic medium.
- B) Incorrect: The passage doesn't suggest that bacterial activity is being observed, only the survival of modified cells.
- C) Incorrect: The resistance isn't developed naturally but is transferred through genetic modification.
- D) Incorrect: This contradicts the passage's logic, as the modified tissue becomes more resistant, not more vulnerable.
