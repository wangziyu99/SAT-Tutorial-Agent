## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya, Sithole, Welsh, and Dana (2024).

## Passage
The heart's positioning within the thoracic cavity exhibits remarkable variability, challenging conventional anatomical assumptions. While textbook illustrations often depict a standardized cardiac position, the reality is far more complex. In patients with certain anatomical variations, the heart may adopt _________, particularly when influenced by underlying pathological conditions. This adaptability, while essential for maintaining cardiovascular function, presents unique challenges for medical imaging professionals. Understanding these positional variations becomes crucial in clinical settings, where precise imaging is necessary for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Recent advances in echocardiographic techniques have enhanced our ability to visualize these variations, though the interpretation of such images requires sophisticated knowledge of both normal and variant cardiac positions.

## Question
Which choice most logically completes the text while maintaining the analytical tone and supporting the passage's main idea about cardiac positioning?

## Skill
Inferences

## Choices
- A) unexpected orientations and positions
- B) standard anatomical configurations
- C) compromised functional capacity
- D) traditional placement patterns

## Answer
- A) Correct: This choice maintains the passage's emphasis on variability and supports the broader discussion of cardiac positioning challenges.
- B) Incorrect: Contradicts the passage's main point about variability in cardiac positioning.
- C) Incorrect: Shifts focus away from positioning to functionality, which isn't the main topic.
- D) Incorrect: Contradicts the passage's emphasis on non-traditional positioning patterns.
