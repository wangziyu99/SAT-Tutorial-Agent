## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya, Sithole, Welsh, and Dana (2024).

## Passage
In medical imaging, the interaction between ultrasound waves and biological tissues can produce various artifacts that affect image quality. When these waves encounter structures with significantly different acoustic properties, they often generate _________. This phenomenon is particularly evident in cases where ultrasound beams interact with highly reflective or attenuating tissues, resulting in decreased beam intensity and obscured visualization of deeper structures. The effect is most pronounced at interfaces between tissues with markedly different acoustic impedances, such as soft tissue-bone or soft tissue-gas boundaries. Understanding these imaging artifacts is crucial for accurate diagnostic interpretation, as they can either mask important anatomical features or, paradoxically, serve as useful diagnostic markers in certain clinical scenarios.

## Question
Which choice most logically completes the text?

## Skill
Inferences

## Choices
- A) predictable distortions that can both hinder and aid diagnosis
- B) random interference patterns that always compromise image quality
- C) enhanced resolution of underlying anatomical structures
- D) consistent improvements in tissue differentiation

## Answer
- A) Correct: This answer accurately captures the dual nature of artifacts as both potential obstacles and diagnostic tools, while maintaining the technical tone of the passage.
- B) Incorrect: The passage suggests artifacts are predictable, not random, and doesn't state they always compromise quality.
- C) Incorrect: The passage indicates artifacts typically obscure rather than enhance resolution.
- D) Incorrect: The passage discusses how artifacts can obscure tissue visualization, not improve differentiation.
