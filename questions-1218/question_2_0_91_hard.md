## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Arbin Thapaliya, Alec Sithole, Michael Welsh, and Gaston Dana (2024).

## Passage
Recent advances in medical imaging have revolutionized diagnostic capabilities, particularly in the realm of ultrasound technology. While conventional imaging methods rely on radiation or magnetic fields, ultrasound leverages the subtle interactions between sound waves and biological tissues to create detailed anatomical maps. This sophisticated interplay occurs through a process of ___________, where sound waves encounter varying tissue densities and reflect back to the transducer with distinctive signatures. The resulting data undergoes complex algorithmic processing to generate real-time visualizations, enabling clinicians to observe dynamic physiological processes. Beyond its diagnostic utility, this technology has found applications in therapeutic interventions, where focused ultrasound waves can be used to precisely target pathological tissues while sparing surrounding healthy structures.

## Question
Which choice best completes the blank to maintain the passage's technical explanation while preserving its analytical tone?

## Skill
Text Structure and Purpose

## Choices
- A) acoustic impedance variation
- B) sonic wave transmission
- C) frequency modulation
- D) vibrational resonance

## Answer
- A) Correct: This choice maintains the technical precision of the passage while accurately describing the physical principle behind ultrasound imaging.
- B) Incorrect: While related to ultrasound, this term is too general and doesn't capture the specific interaction being described.
- C) Incorrect: This term, while technical, relates more to radio communications than ultrasound imaging principles.
- D) Incorrect: This phrase is technically imprecise and doesn't accurately describe the mechanism of ultrasound imaging.
