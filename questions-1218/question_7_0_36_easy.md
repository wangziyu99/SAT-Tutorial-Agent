## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024).

## Passage
Genetic modification has revolutionized crop breeding. For example_ glufosinate-tolerant crops contain special genes that can neutralize herbicides. These modified plants carry either the bar or pat genes, which were originally found in bacteria. When these genes are successfully incorporated into plant chromosomes, they create what scientists call a hemizygous condition. This means the plant carries a single copy of the introduced gene.

## Question
Which choice best completes the text while conforming to the conventions of Standard English?

## Skill
Boundaries

## Choices
