## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya et al. (2024), published in the Journal of Medical Physics.

## Passage
In establishing safety protocols for diagnostic ultrasound procedures, the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM) emphasizes the critical balance between effective imaging and patient safety. The ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) principle guides practitioners in minimizing exposure while maintaining diagnostic quality. Recent studies have shown that tissue temperature elevation correlates exponentially with the Thermal Index (TI) values, particularly in sensitive examinations. The recommended maximum exposure duration varies significantly based on the TI range: for values below 0.7, exposure times of up to 60 minutes are considered safe, while TI values between 2.5 and 3.0 necessitate limiting exposure to under 1 minute. This stringent correlation becomes particularly crucial in obstetric and neonatal examinations, where tissue sensitivity is markedly elevated.

## Question
Which choice best supports the passage's claim about the relationship between TI values and exposure duration?

## Skill
Command of Evidence (Quantitative)

## Choices
- A) "The ALARA principle guides practitioners in minimizing exposure while maintaining diagnostic quality."
- B) "tissue temperature elevation correlates exponentially with the Thermal Index (TI) values"
- C) "for values below 0.7, exposure times of up to 60 minutes are considered safe, while TI values between 2.5 and 3.0 necessitate limiting exposure to under 1 minute"
- D) "This stringent correlation becomes particularly crucial in obstetric and neonatal examinations"

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: This statement describes a general principle but doesn't provide specific evidence about TI values and exposure duration.
- B) Incorrect: While this indicates a relationship, it doesn't specifically address exposure duration.
- C) Correct: This choice provides specific numerical evidence demonstrating the inverse relationship between TI values and allowable exposure times.
- D) Incorrect: This statement mentions the importance of the correlation but doesn't provide supporting evidence for the relationship.
