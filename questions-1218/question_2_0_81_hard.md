## Passage
Valvular dysfunction in the heart presents primarily in two distinct manifestations, each with significant hemodynamic consequences. In stenotic conditions, the narrowing of valve apertures creates a restrictive flow pattern that compromises cardiac output and potentially induces retrograde pressure effects. This phenomenon is particularly evident in aortic stenosis, where the left ventricle often undergoes pathological remodeling in response to increased afterload. Alternatively, valvular incompetence manifests as regurgitation, where the failure of complete valve closure permits retrograde blood flow during inappropriate phases of the cardiac cycle. This dysfunction disrupts the normal unidirectional flow of blood and can precipitate chamber dilation and eventual heart failure if left uncorrected. Modern echocardiographic imaging has revolutionized our ability to ___________ these conditions, enabling precise quantification of both structural and functional abnormalities.

## Question
Which choice best completes the passage while maintaining its analytical tone and supporting its central purpose?

## Skill
Text Structure and Purpose

## Choices
- A) diagnose and monitor
- B) visualize and document
- C) characterize and evaluate
- D) identify and treat

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: Too clinical and simplistic for the passage's academic tone
- B) Incorrect: Too observational and lacks the analytical component
- C) Correct: Best matches the analytical tone and supports the passage's purpose of explaining how modern technology enables both qualitative and quantitative assessment of valve disorders
- D) Incorrect: "Treat" extends beyond the scope of diagnostic imaging discussed in the passage
