## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024).

## Passage
The success of modern plant breeding _____ largely on the careful selection of parent plants with desirable traits. When breeders identify a beneficial gene in a wild variety, they must transfer it to commercial cultivars through multiple generations of crossing. This process requires patience and precision, as each generation needs to be carefully evaluated. The goal is to develop new varieties that combine the best characteristics of both parent plants while maintaining the agricultural performance that farmers expect.
