## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya, Sithole, Welsh, and Dana (2024).

## Passage
The piezoelectric effect, first observed in the 19th century by Pierre and Jacques Curie, demonstrates how certain crystalline materials can _____ electrical energy when subjected to mechanical stress. This phenomenon has proven instrumental in modern medical imaging, particularly in ultrasound technology. When these specialized materials experience compression or expansion, they generate electrical potentials that can be precisely measured and manipulated. The process exemplifies a remarkable instance of energy transduction, where mechanical force is converted into electrical signals with minimal loss of information. This property has revolutionized diagnostic medicine by enabling the creation of detailed internal body images through non-invasive means.

## Question
Which choice best completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

## Skill
Words in Context

## Choices
- A) transmute
- B) transduce
- C) transpose
- D) translate

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: "Transmute" suggests a complete change in form or nature, which is too dramatic for the scientific process being described
- B) Correct: "Transduce" is the precise scientific term for converting one form of energy into another, making it the most accurate choice for describing the piezoelectric effect
- C) Incorrect: "Transpose" primarily means to switch positions or transfer to a different place, which doesn't capture the energy conversion process
- D) Incorrect: "Translate" typically refers to converting languages or expressing something in different terms, not energy conversion
