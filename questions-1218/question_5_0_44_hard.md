## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Arbin Thapaliya, Alec Sithole, Michael Welsh, and Gaston Dana (2024).

## Passage
While 2D ultrasound remains the standard diagnostic tool in medical imaging, recent advances in 3D/4D technology have revolutionized fetal cardiovascular scanning. The technology's ability to provide real-time motion-gated cardiac imaging has proven particularly valuable in detecting congenital heart defects. However, the clinical advantages of 3D/4D imaging extend beyond cardiac applications. The technology enables physicians to acquire qualitative and quantitative sonographic volume data through multiplanar imaging, surface rendering, and semiautomated volume calculation. These capabilities _____ conventional 2D imaging, though the latter's cost-effectiveness and widespread availability ensure its continued relevance in routine diagnostics.

## Question
Which choice best completes the sentence while maintaining the analytical tone of the passage and accurately reflecting the relationship between 3D/4D and 2D imaging technologies?

## Skill
Command of Evidence (Textual, Quantitative)

## Choices
- A) transcend the limitations of
- B) make obsolete
- C) complement the functionality of
- D) marginally improve upon

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: Too absolute and implies complete superiority, which contradicts the passage's balanced perspective
- B) Incorrect: Contradicts the passage's statement about 2D's continued relevance
- C) Correct: Best reflects the passage's nuanced discussion of how 3D/4D technology adds to, rather than replaces, 2D imaging capabilities
- D) Incorrect: Understates the significance of 3D/4D's advantages as described in the passage
