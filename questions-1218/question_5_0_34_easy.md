## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024), discussing common methods of plant genetic transformation.

## Passage
Scientists have developed several methods to insert new genes into plant cells. Two widely used approaches are Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and biolistics transformation. The biolistics method uses high pressure to shoot DNA-coated metal particles into plant cells. Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a soil bacterium, naturally transfers its DNA into plants, causing crown gall disease. Researchers have modified this bacterium by removing its disease-causing properties while preserving its ability to transfer DNA. This discovery has made Agrobacterium an invaluable _______________ in modern plant genetic engineering.

## Question
Which choice best completes the passage while maintaining its scientific accuracy and formal tone?

## Skill
Command of Evidence (Textual)

## Choices
- A) tool
- B) helper
- C) friend
- D) assistant

## Answer
- A) Correct: "Tool" maintains the scientific tone and accurately describes Agrobacterium's role in genetic engineering
- B) Incorrect: "Helper" is too informal for the scientific context
- C) Incorrect: "Friend" is overly casual and anthropomorphizes the bacterium
- D) Incorrect: "Assistant" inappropriately personifies the bacterium and is too informal
