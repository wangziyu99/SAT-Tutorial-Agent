## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024).

## Passage
Plant breeders use selective breeding to develop crops with desired traits. One common method involves carefully choosing plants with specific characteristics over multiple generations. For example, when developing disease-resistant wheat, breeders might start with a diverse group of plants and deliberately expose them to disease. They then select and save seeds only from plants that show the strongest resistance. By repeating this process for several generations, breeders can create new varieties where beneficial traits become more common in the population. This approach helps develop hardier crops that can better withstand environmental challenges while providing improved yields for farmers.

## Question
Which choice best states the main idea of the passage?

## Skill
Central Ideas and Details

## Choices
- A) Plant breeders use repeated selection over generations to develop crops with desired characteristics
- B) Disease resistance is the most important trait that plant breeders try to develop
- C) Modern farming requires new varieties of wheat that can produce higher yields
- D) Plant breeding is a complex process that takes many years to complete

## Answer
- A) Correct: This accurately captures the central focus of the passage - how breeders select plants over multiple generations to enhance desired traits
- B) Incorrect: Disease resistance is only used as an example and is not the main focus
- C) Incorrect: While yield is mentioned, it's not the main idea of the passage
- D) Incorrect: While this is true, it's too general and misses the specific focus on selective breeding for desired traits
