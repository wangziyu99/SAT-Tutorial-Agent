## Abstract
The following texts are adapted from "Advances in Medical Imaging" by Dr. Sarah Chen (2024) and "Clinical Applications of Ultrasound Technology" by Dr. James Morrison (2023).

## Passage
Text 1:
Modern ultrasound technology relies on the precise manipulation of sound waves to generate detailed medical images. The piezoelectric effect, whereby certain crystals produce electricity when mechanically stressed, forms the cornerstone of ultrasound transducer functionality. These crystals simultaneously act as both emitters and receivers of high-frequency sound waves, converting electrical signals into mechanical vibrations and vice versa.

Text 2:
While conventional imaging modalities expose patients to ionizing radiation, ultrasound presents a safer alternative for diagnostic procedures. However, the interpretation of ultrasound images requires considerable expertise, as artifacts and acoustic shadows can complicate image analysis. The operator's skill in manipulating the transducer significantly influences image quality and diagnostic accuracy.

## Question
How would the author of Text 1 most likely respond to the concerns raised in Text 2 regarding image interpretation?

## Skill
Cross-Text Connections

## Choices
- A) Acknowledgment that the technical sophistication of ultrasound technology may contribute to interpretation challenges
- B) Dismissal of interpretation concerns as irrelevant given the fundamental physics of ultrasound
- C) Suggestion that piezoelectric crystals could be modified to eliminate imaging artifacts
- D) Argument that operator skill is more important than understanding the underlying technology

## Answer
- A) Correct: The technical explanation in Text 1 supports the idea that the complexity of ultrasound technology could contribute to interpretation challenges
- B) Incorrect: Text 1's detailed technical explanation suggests an appreciation for ultrasound's complexity
- C) Incorrect: Text 1 doesn't suggest that piezoelectric crystals can be modified to address interpretation issues
- D) Incorrect: Text 1's focus on technical aspects suggests equal importance of understanding the technology
