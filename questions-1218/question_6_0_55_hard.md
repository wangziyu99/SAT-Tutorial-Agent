## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya et al. (2024), discussing medical equipment sterilization protocols.

## Passage
Medical equipment sterilization protocols follow a hierarchical classification system based on infection risk. Critical equipment that penetrates tissue requires complete sterilization, while semicritical items encountering bodily fluids demand thorough disinfection. When implementing these protocols, healthcare facilities must consider that _________, though this principle often conflicts with practical constraints in emergency situations.

## Question
Which choice most logically completes the text?

## Skill
Inferences

## Choices
- A) the highest level of sterilization should always be applied regardless of the equipment's classification
- B) different sterilization methods may be appropriate for different types of equipment
- C) equipment classification determines the minimum required level of sterilization
- D) emergency situations justify bypassing standard sterilization protocols

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: Too extreme and contradicts the established hierarchical system
- B) Incorrect: Too general and doesn't address the logical relationship between protocols and implementation
- C) Correct: This completion best maintains the logical flow by connecting the hierarchical classification system to its practical implementation while suggesting why conflicts might arise in emergency situations
- D) Incorrect: Contradicts the passage's emphasis on proper sterilization protocols
