## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya et al. (2024), published in the Journal of Medical Imaging.

## Passage
Recent advances in ultrasound imaging technology have revealed that the complexity of artifact formation _____ far beyond simple reflection patterns. While most medical professionals understand basic ultrasound principles, the intricate relationship between wave propagation and tissue interfaces creates phenomena that challenge conventional interpretation. Mirror artifacts, which appear as symmetric duplicates of actual structures, demonstrate how ultrasound waves can produce deceptive images when encountering highly reflective surfaces. These artifacts, though potentially confusing, often provide valuable diagnostic information about tissue composition and anatomical relationships that would otherwise remain undetected.

## Question
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English while maintaining the academic tone of the passage?

## Skill
Form, Structure, and Sense

## Choices
- A) extends
- B) extend
- C) extending
- D) had extended

## Answer
- A) Correct: "Extends" is correct because the singular subject "complexity" requires a singular verb in the present tense to maintain parallel structure with the rest of the passage.
- B) Incorrect: "Extend" is plural and doesn't agree with the singular subject "complexity."
- C) Incorrect: "Extending" is a participle and creates an incomplete sentence when used as the main verb.
- D) Incorrect: "Had extended" shifts to past perfect tense, which is inconsistent with the present tense used throughout the passage.
