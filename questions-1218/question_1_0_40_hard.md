## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Arbin Thapaliya, Alec Sithole, Michael Welsh, and Gaston Dana (2024).

## Passage
In fluid dynamics, the behavior of blood flow through vessels exhibits distinct characteristics depending on various factors. When blood moves through normal vessels, it demonstrates a parabolic velocity profile, with molecules at the center moving fastest while those near the vessel walls experience greater resistance. However, when blood encounters vessel constrictions or irregular surfaces, its flow pattern may become _________, creating unpredictable movements and temporal variations that deviate from the standard laminar pattern. This phenomenon, quantified by the Reynolds number, can significantly impact cardiovascular health and requires careful monitoring in clinical settings.

## Question
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

## Skill
Words in Context

## Choices
- A) erratic
- B) turbulent
- C) chaotic
- D) disorganized

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: While "erratic" suggests irregular movement, it lacks the specific scientific connotation needed in this fluid dynamics context.
- B) Correct: "Turbulent" is the precise technical term used in fluid dynamics to describe this specific type of irregular flow pattern, making it the most appropriate choice in this scientific context.
- C) Incorrect: Although "chaotic" implies disorder, it's too general and lacks the specific scientific meaning required here.
- D) Incorrect: "Disorganized" is too colloquial and doesn't capture the specific physical phenomenon being described.
