## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024).

## Passage
Mutation breeding has become an essential tool in modern agriculture. When scientists discover mutant plant lines with desirable traits, they must carefully evaluate these new varieties. In a recent study, researchers screened over 2 million seedlings for herbicide tolerance, ultimately finding just one promising line. However, this line showed a minor drawback: slightly delayed seed germination. To address this issue, scientists used a traditional breeding technique called backcrossing to combine the beneficial mutation with existing favorable traits. This process illustrates a common challenge in mutation breeding, where new varieties often possess both advantageous and undesirable characteristics. Through careful breeding and selection, scientists work to maintain the beneficial traits while eliminating unwanted features.

## Question
Which choice best describes the main purpose of this passage?

## Skill
Text Structure and Purpose

## Choices
- A) To explain how mutation breeding works and its challenges in developing new plant varieties
- B) To compare different methods of plant breeding in modern agriculture
- C) To argue for the superiority of mutation breeding over traditional breeding methods
- D) To describe the specific process of screening seedlings for herbicide tolerance

## Answer
- A) Correct: The passage primarily explains mutation breeding and discusses its challenges, particularly the need to balance desired and undesired traits.
- B) Incorrect: While traditional breeding is mentioned, the passage doesn't compare different breeding methods.
- C) Incorrect: The passage doesn't make claims about mutation breeding's superiority.
- D) Incorrect: While seedling screening is mentioned, it's just one example supporting the broader purpose.
