## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya, Sithole, Welsh, and Dana (2024).

## Passage
Due to the distinctive echogenic properties (sonar beam reflectivity) of biliary duct walls, ultrasound imaging enables precise visualization of the hepatic system. When pathological conditions arise, the ductal system may exhibit dilation, often resulting from downstream obstructions such as gallbladder calculi or pancreatic malignancies. The liver's reflective properties make it particularly suitable for ultrasound examination, allowing clinicians to detect both chronic conditions, such as ascites from persistent liver disease, and acute pathologies like intra-abdominal hemorrhage following trauma. In healthy individuals, _________, but the presence of abnormal fluid accumulation forces these surfaces apart, creating a sonographically distinct dark space that serves as a crucial diagnostic indicator.

## Question
Which choice most effectively completes the sentence with accurate anatomical information that maintains the passage's technical precision while supporting its discussion of ultrasound diagnostics?

## Skill
Command of Evidence (Textual, Quantitative)

## Choices
A) the liver and kidney surfaces maintain direct contact
B) organ boundaries remain clearly defined
C) tissue density appears uniform on ultrasound
D) fluid levels remain consistently stable

## Answer
A) Correct: This choice accurately reflects the anatomical relationship described in the passage and supports the subsequent discussion of how pathological fluid accumulation creates separation between these surfaces.
B) Incorrect: While plausible, this choice is too general and doesn't specifically support the passage's discussion of fluid accumulation effects.
C) Incorrect: This choice contradicts the passage's emphasis on distinctive echogenic properties and tissue differentiation.
D) Incorrect: This choice introduces a concept not supported by the passage's context and doesn't relate to the anatomical relationship being described.
