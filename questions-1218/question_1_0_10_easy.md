## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024).

## Passage
In modern greenhouses, plant scientists have developed efficient methods for growing hybrid plants. When preparing for cross-pollination, researchers must first identify healthy parent plants that will produce the desired traits. The selected plants are then _______ to a controlled environment where temperature and humidity can be carefully monitored. This careful transfer process ensures that the plants remain viable and helps prevent any unwanted cross-contamination that could affect the experimental results.

## Question
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

## Skill
Words in Context

## Choices
- A) relocated
- B) switched
- C) moved
- D) transported

## Answer
- A) Correct: "Relocated" is the most precise choice as it specifically implies a deliberate, careful movement from one location to another, which fits the scientific context.
- B) Incorrect: "Switched" implies an exchange between two things, which is not the meaning intended in this context.
- C) Incorrect: While "moved" is technically correct, it is too general and lacks the precision needed in scientific writing.
- D) Incorrect: While "transported" could work, it typically implies longer distances and is less precise than "relocated" in this context.
