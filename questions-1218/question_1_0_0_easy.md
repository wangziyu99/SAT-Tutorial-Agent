## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024).

## Passage
Plants have developed remarkable ways to reproduce and maintain their species over time. While some plants can only reproduce through one method, many species are capable of _____ themselves through multiple reproductive strategies. The most common method is sexual reproduction, where pollen combines with egg cells to form seeds. However, some plants can also reproduce asexually, creating new individuals directly from their existing tissue. This flexibility in reproduction methods has helped plants adapt to various environmental conditions and ensure their survival across different habitats.
