## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024).

## Passage
Modern plant breeding requires careful selection of parent plants with desirable traits. The success of any breeding program _________ on identifying plants that possess both high yield potential and resistance to common diseases. At the Iowa State University research center, scientists recently developed a new soybean variety by crossing two parent plants. The first parent was chosen for its exceptional yield and large seed size, while the second parent contributed important disease-resistant genes. Through systematic testing and selection, researchers were able to combine these beneficial traits into a single improved variety.

## Question
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

## Skill
Words in Context

## Choices
- A) depends
- B) relies
- C) rests
- D) hangs

## Answer
- A) Correct: "Depends" is the most precise and natural choice in this context, as it clearly expresses the fundamental relationship between breeding success and plant selection.
- B) Incorrect: While "relies" is similar in meaning, it is slightly less idiomatic in this scientific context.
- C) Incorrect: "Rests" is too casual for the formal, scientific tone of the passage.
- D) Incorrect: "Hangs" is too informal and imprecise for the academic nature of the text.
