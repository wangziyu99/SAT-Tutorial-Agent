## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Thapaliya et al. (2024), discussing the historical development of cardiac treatment methods.

## Passage
Early cardiac treatments relied heavily on observable symptoms and rudimentary diagnostic tools. Physicians would often detect fluid accumulation in patients' extremities, indicating potential heart dysfunction. _____ sophisticated imaging techniques became available, doctors had to rely primarily on physical examination and auscultation to diagnose cardiac conditions. This limitation led to significant challenges in accurately assessing the severity of heart conditions. Modern cardiac imaging has revolutionized our understanding of heart function, enabling physicians to visualize structural abnormalities and blood flow patterns in real-time. These technological advances have dramatically improved both diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes.

## Question
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

## Skill
Transitions

## Choices
- A) Unless
- B) Before
- C) Although
- D) Whether

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: "Unless" suggests a conditional relationship that doesn't fit the temporal sequence described
- B) Correct: "Before" establishes the appropriate temporal relationship between historical and modern diagnostic methods
- C) Incorrect: "Although" suggests a contrast that isn't supported by the passage's logical flow
- D) Incorrect: "Whether" implies uncertainty where the passage presents a clear historical progression
