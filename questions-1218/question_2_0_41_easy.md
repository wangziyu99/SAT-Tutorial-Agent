## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024).

## Passage
Modern plant breeding requires careful documentation of each step in developing resistant crop varieties. In our laboratory, we follow a systematic approach to tracking plant development. First, we record the planting dates and locations for each generation of plants. Next, we maintain detailed notes on environmental conditions, including temperature and rainfall. When testing for disease resistance, we document both the presence of natural pathogens and any artificial infections we introduce. The most critical aspect is recording the survival rates and growth patterns of different plant varieties. This information helps us identify which plants show the strongest resistance to diseases and pests. By maintaining these detailed records, we can trace the development of successful varieties back through multiple generations of breeding.

## Question
Which choice best describes the main purpose of this passage?

## Skill
Text Structure and Purpose

## Choices
A) To explain the importance of record-keeping in plant breeding
B) To describe the process of creating disease-resistant plants
C) To compare different methods of plant breeding
D) To argue for better documentation in scientific research

## Answer
A) Correct: The passage primarily focuses on explaining why and how records are kept during plant breeding, with specific examples of what information needs to be documented.
B) Incorrect: While disease resistance is mentioned, the passage focuses more on documentation than the actual breeding process.
C) Incorrect: The passage doesn't compare different breeding methods; it focuses on one aspect of the breeding process - documentation.
D) Incorrect: While documentation is discussed, the passage describes current practices rather than arguing for improvement.
