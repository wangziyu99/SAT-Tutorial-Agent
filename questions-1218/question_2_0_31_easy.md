## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024).

## Passage
Scientists have developed fascinating methods to identify different plant varieties through DNA analysis. When examining soybean plants, researchers can distinguish between conventional and mutant varieties by looking at their genetic makeup. They use special enzymes that act like molecular scissors, cutting DNA at specific points. When scientists analyze these DNA fragments using a gel-based method, they can easily identify whether a plant has the traditional genetic pattern, the mutant pattern, or a mixture of both. This process is similar to creating a unique fingerprint for each plant variety, making it easier for researchers to track and study different soybean types. The method has revolutionized how we classify and study plant varieties, providing a reliable way to identify specific genetic traits.
