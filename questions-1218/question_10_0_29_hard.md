## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" by Arbin Thapaliya et al. (2024), discussing the technical aspects of ultrasound imaging artifacts and transducer technology.

## Passage
Slice thickness artifacts in ultrasound imaging can significantly impact diagnostic accuracy. These artifacts emerge when the beam dimension substantially exceeds the reflector size. _____ this dimensional mismatch creates false debris patterns in cyst images, the problem extends beyond mere visual distortion to potentially compromising clinical interpretations. Modern solutions have emerged through technological advancement: tissue harmonic imaging and thinner transducer arrays effectively minimize these artifacts. The evolution of transducer technology has been particularly noteworthy in this regard, with contemporary linear sequential arrays incorporating between 256 to 512 elements, offering unprecedented sensitivity when positioned perpendicular to the examination surface.

## Question
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

## Skill
Transitions

## Choices
- A) Although
- B) Moreover,
- C) Nevertheless,
- D) Because

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: "Although" suggests a contrast that doesn't exist between the beam dimension and the creation of debris patterns
- B) Incorrect: "Moreover" suggests an additional point, but the relationship is causal
- C) Incorrect: "Nevertheless" implies a contradiction that isn't present in the logical flow
- D) Correct: "Because" establishes the proper causal relationship between the beam dimension mismatch and the resulting debris patterns in images
