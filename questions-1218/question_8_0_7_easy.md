## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Plant Breeding Methods" by Walter R. Fehr and Walter P. Suza (2024).

## Passage
The diversity of flowering plants in nature _____ remarkable, with three main types of flowers being particularly notable. Perfect flowers contain both male and female organs within the same flower. Monoecious species have male and female flowers on different parts of the same plant, while dioecious species have male and female flowers on entirely separate plants. This variation in flower structure plays a crucial role in plant breeding and reproduction.
