## Abstract
The following text is adapted from "Ultrasound Physics and its Application in Medicine" (2024) by Thapaliya, Sithole, Welsh, and Dana.

## Passage
In musculoskeletal ultrasound imaging, different tissue types exhibit distinct sonographic characteristics that aid in their identification and assessment. Muscle tissue presents as hypoechoic with distinctive septations, displaying a pennate pattern longitudinally and a starry-night appearance transversely during dynamic examination. Bone tissue, being highly reflective due to significant acoustic impedance mismatch, appears markedly hyperechoic. While adipose tissue and cartilage typically manifest as hypoechoic, nerves present a unique honeycomb pattern combining both hypoechoic and hyperechoic elements. In pathological conditions, acute injuries characteristically show ___________, whereas chronic conditions typically demonstrate hypoechoic changes with potential atrophy and calcification.

## Question
Which choice most effectively completes the passage by describing the sonographic characteristics of acute injuries based on the information presented?

## Skill
Command of Evidence (Textual, Quantitative)

## Choices
- A) hyperechoic features with reduced vascularity and minimal fiber disruption
- B) hyperechoic changes accompanied by hypervascularity and fiber disruption
- C) hypoechoic patterns with increased tissue density and fiber regeneration
- D) mixed echogenic patterns with minimal structural changes

## Answer
- A) Incorrect: Contradicts the passage's implication about increased vascularity in acute injuries
- B) Correct: Aligns with the passage's pattern of contrasting acute and chronic conditions, and maintains consistency with the technical terminology established
- C) Incorrect: Describes characteristics more consistent with chronic conditions
- D) Incorrect: Too vague and fails to capture the specific characteristics of acute injuries
